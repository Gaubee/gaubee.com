href=\"http://v.163.com/movie/2012/1/O/C/M78DAQ7KH_M8BL7FVOC.html\">贫困，金钱与爱</a></h2>\n<p>The stories we tell about each other</p>\n<p>我们互相讲述的故事</p>\n<p>matter very much.</p>\n<p>非常重要</p>\n<p>The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.</p>\n<p>我们谈论与自己生活相关故事是有意义的</p>\n<p>And most of all,</p>\n<p>而我认为最重要的是</p>\n<p>I think the way that we participate in each other's stories</p>\n<p>我们参与到他人故事的方式</p>\n<p>is of deep importance.</p>\n<p>才是至关重要的</p>\n<p>I was six years old</p>\n<p>我六岁时</p>\n<p>when I first heard stories about the poor.</p>\n<p>当我第一次听到关于穷人的故事的时候</p>\n<p>Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,</p>\n<p>我并没有直接从穷人口中听到这些故事</p>\n<p>I heard them from my Sunday school teacher</p>\n<p>我从教堂周日学校的老师那里听到这些故事</p>\n<p>and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.</p>\n<p>和耶稣，也就是这些老师那里</p>\n<p>I remember learning that people who were poor</p>\n<p>我记得我学到了穷人</p>\n<p>needed something material --</p>\n<p>需要物质帮助</p>\n<p>food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.</p>\n<p>如食物，衣服，住处，那些他们没有的</p>\n<p>And I also was taught, coupled with that,</p>\n<p>我还学到了</p>\n<p>that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --</p>\n<p>我们这些五六岁的孩子应该做的是</p>\n<p>it was our job, apparently, to help.</p>\n<p>很明显，去帮助</p>\n<p>This is what Jesus asked of us.</p>\n<p>这也是耶稣需要我们做的</p>\n<p>And then he said, \"What you do for the least of these, you do for me.\"</p>\n<p>他还说，你为他们做的就是为我做的</p>\n<p>Now I was pretty psyched.</p>\n<p>现在， 我被极大的鼓舞了</p>\n<p>I was very eager to be useful in the world --</p>\n<p>我非常热切地希望自己能向世界证明自己的意义</p>\n<p>I think we all have that feeling.</p>\n<p>相信我们都有这样的感觉</p>\n<p>And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.</p>\n<p>此外，有意思的是上帝也需要帮助</p>\n<p>That was news to me,</p>\n<p>那对我来说真是个新闻</p>\n<p>and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.</p>\n<p>而且，这是貌似一个很重要的事情值得我们参与</p>\n<p>But I also learned very soon thereafter</p>\n<p>但是自从耶稣说了那句话之后，我也很快地理解了耶稣所说</p>\n<p>that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,</p>\n<p>那我同时将其释义为</p>\n<p>the poor would always be with us.</p>\n<p>贫穷和我们同在</p>\n<p>This frustrated and confused me;</p>\n<p>这让我沮丧和迷惑</p>\n<p>I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment</p>\n<p>我感觉我被安排了一个</p>\n<p>that I had to do, and I was excited to do,</p>\n<p>不得不做的同时令人振奋的作业</p>\n<p>but no matter what I would do, I would fail.</p>\n<p>但是不论我做什么，我都会失败</p>\n<p>So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,</p>\n<p>因此我感到迷茫，有点郁闷以及恼怒</p>\n<p>like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.</p>\n<p>好像我似乎误解了这里的一些东西</p>\n<p>And I felt overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>同时我感到了压力</p>\n<p>And for the first time,</p>\n<p>这也是第一次</p>\n<p>I began to fear this group of people</p>\n<p>我开始害怕一类人群</p>\n<p>and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.</p>\n<p>并对这一人群有负面的情绪</p>\n<p>I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals</p>\n<p>我的脑袋里呈现出这些人组成的长队</p>\n<p>that were never going away, that would always be with us.</p>\n<p>这个长队将一直伴随我们，永不会离去</p>\n<p>They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,</p>\n<p>他们会总是不停地要求我的帮助，要求我给他们东西</p>\n<p>which I was excited to do,</p>\n<p>这些虽然都是我喜欢做的</p>\n<p>but I didn't know how it was going to work.</p>\n<p>但是我并不知道将来会发生什么</p>\n<p>And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,</p>\n<p>我不知道但我无物可给的时候将会发生什么</p>\n<p>especially if the problem was never going away.</p>\n<p>特别是这个问题永远不会离去</p>\n<p>In the years following,</p>\n<p>几年之后</p>\n<p>the other stories I heard about the poor growing up</p>\n<p>我听到一些其他的故事关于减贫</p>\n<p>were no more positive.</p>\n<p>并不是那么积极</p>\n<p>For example, I saw pictures and images</p>\n<p>例如，我曾经看到了令人悲伤和苦恼的</p>\n<p>frequently of sadness and suffering.</p>\n<p>一些照片和图像</p>\n<p>I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.</p>\n<p>我听到穷人生活的不尽如人意</p>\n<p>I heard about disease, I heard about war --</p>\n<p>关于疾病，关于战争</p>\n<p>they always seemed to be kind of related.</p>\n<p>似乎这些都是和贫穷相关联的</p>\n<p>And in general,</p>\n<p>总的来说</p>\n<p>I got this sort of idea</p>\n<p>我有个这样的想法</p>\n<p>that the poor in the world lived lives</p>\n<p>穷人生活的世界</p>\n<p>that were wrought with suffering and sadness,</p>\n<p>充满悲伤，充满苦闷</p>\n<p>devastation, hopelessness.</p>\n<p>充满破坏，充满绝望</p>\n<p>And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,</p>\n<p>在那之后，我想到我们大家的感觉</p>\n<p>is this predictable response,</p>\n<p>就是这个可预知的回应</p>\n<p>where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.</p>\n<p>当我每次听到穷人时，我开始感觉不舒服</p>\n<p>I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,</p>\n<p>由于我的相对富裕让我开始感觉到罪恶</p>\n<p>because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.</p>\n<p>很明显的是因为我没有尽我所能把事情做得更好</p>\n<p>And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.</p>\n<p>因此，我感到羞愧</p>\n<p>And so naturally,</p>\n<p>自然地</p>\n<p>I started to distance myself.</p>\n<p>我开始疏远我自己</p>\n<p>I stopped listening to their stories</p>\n<p>我不再像以前一样细心地倾听</p>\n<p>quite as closely as I had before.</p>\n<p>他们的故事</p>\n<p>And I stopped expecting things to really change.</p>\n<p>我不再期望事情能真正有所改变</p>\n<p>Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.</p>\n<p>我还是会给予。表面看来，我似乎还在继续参与</p>\n<p>I gave of my time and my money,</p>\n<p>给予我的时间和金钱</p>\n<p>I gave when solutions were on sale.</p>\n<p>我给予的都是廉价的方案</p>\n<p>The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.</p>\n<p>一杯咖啡就是救一个孩子的命，是这样的</p>\n<p>I mean who can argue with that?</p>\n<p>我的意思是谁能说那是错的呢？</p>\n<p>I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid</p>\n<p>当我无路可退时，当我难以推辞时，我才给予</p>\n<p>and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough</p>\n<p>总体来说，负面情绪驱使我给予</p>\n<p>that I gave to relieve my own suffering,</p>\n<p>我的给予是为了减轻我自己的烦恼</p>\n<p>not someone else's.</p>\n<p>而不是其他人的</p>\n<p>The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,</p>\n<p>确实，我离开了那里地方</p>\n<p>not out of a genuine place of hope</p>\n<p>但我并没有远离希望之地</p>\n<p>and excitement to help and of generosity.</p>\n<p>没有远离帮助他人和慷慨解囊的兴奋</p>\n<p>It became a transaction for me,</p>\n<p>它变成了我的一个转折点</p>\n<p>became sort of a trade.</p>\n<p>变成了一种交易</p>\n<p>I was purchasing something --</p>\n<p>我是在购买什么东西</p>\n<p>I was buying my right to go on with my day</p>\n<p>我是在购买我继续生存</p>\n<p>and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.</p>\n<p>且不被这些糟糕新闻烦恼的权利</p>\n<p>And I think the way that we go through that sometimes</p>\n<p>我认为我们采用的这种方法，有时候</p>\n<p>can, first of all,</p>\n<p>首先能够</p>\n<p>disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.</p>\n<p>让一部分人或者一些个体灵魂出窍</p>\n<p>And it can also turn into a commodity,</p>\n<p>这种想法也能够变成一种商品</p>\n<p>which is a very scary thing.</p>\n<p>一种令人恐怖的东西</p>\n<p>So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,</p>\n<p>就是正如我所说所想</p>\n<p>we kind of buy our distance,</p>\n<p>我们好像在购买我们之间的距离</p>\n<p>we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.</p>\n<p>我们好像在购买我们继续生活的权利</p>\n<p>I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.</p>\n<p>我想这种交易事实上阻碍了我们得到我们最想得到的东西</p>\n<p>It can get in the way of our desire</p>\n<p>阻碍了我们的愿望</p>\n<p>to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life</p>\n<p>就是给予对他人真正有意义和有用的东西</p>\n<p>and, in short to love.</p>\n<p>即，去爱</p>\n<p>Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me</p>\n<p>欣慰地是，几年之后，我被改变了</p>\n<p>because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.</p>\n<p>因为我听了穆罕默德·尤努斯博士的演讲</p>\n<p>I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,</p>\n<p>在座大部分人也许知道他是谁</p>\n<p>but to give the shorthand version</p>\n<p>但我还是想给没有听说过他的人</p>\n<p>for any who have not heard him speak,</p>\n<p>做个简短的叙述</p>\n<p>Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago</p>\n<p>尤努斯博士在几年前获得了诺贝尔和平奖</p>\n<p>for his work pioneering modern microfinance.</p>\n<p>因为他在现代微金融领域所做的先驱工作</p>\n<p>When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.</p>\n<p>在他获得诺贝尔和平奖三年之前，我就听了他的演讲</p>\n<p>But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --</p>\n<p>如果你对微金融是陌生的，基本上，它可以</p>\n<p>think of that as financial services for the poor.</p>\n<p>理解为给穷人提供的金融服务</p>\n<p>Think of all the things you get at your bank</p>\n<p>就是，所有你在银行里</p>\n<p>and imagine those products and services</p>\n<p>可以获得的以及可以想到的</p>\n<p>tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.</p>\n<p>针对每天只有几美元生活费的人所提供的产品和服务</p>\n<p>Dr. Yunus shared his story,</p>\n<p>尤努斯博士分享了他的故事</p>\n<p>explaining what that was,</p>\n<p>阐述了事情的原貌</p>\n<p>and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.</p>\n<p>以及他和他的格莱珉银行所做到的</p>\n<p>He also talked about, in particular, microlending,</p>\n<p>他也讲到了，特别是，微信贷</p>\n<p>which is a tiny loan</p>\n<p>即，能够帮助人们创业和企业发展的</p>\n<p>that could help someone start or grow a business.</p>\n<p>微型贷款</p>\n<p>Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>他的演讲有如下几点原因让我感到兴奋</p>\n<p>First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world</p>\n<p>第一，我学到了一种新的方法来改变世界</p>\n<p>that, for once, showed me, maybe,</p>\n<p>其曾经向我展示了</p>\n<p>a way to interact with someone</p>\n<p>一种和他人互动的方式</p>\n<p>and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird</p>\n<p>并且给出一种让人不感到怪异的分享资源的方式</p>\n<p>and didn't make me feel bad --</p>\n<p>同时，这种方式不让我感到难堪</p>\n<p>that was exciting.</p>\n<p>很不错</p>\n<p>But more importantly, he told stories about the poor</p>\n<p>但更重要的是，他讲述关于穷人的故事</p>\n<p>that were different than any stories I had heard before.</p>\n<p>和我以前听到的故事有很多不同</p>\n<p>In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.</p>\n<p>事实上，以前听到的穷人在各方面都是弱势的</p>\n<p>He was talking about strong, smart,</p>\n<p>但他所讲的穷人是</p>\n<p>hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day</p>\n<p>坚强，聪明，刻苦的企业家们</p>\n<p>and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.</p>\n<p>这些企业家起早贪黑，努力地工作为了让他们和他们家人有更好的生活</p>\n<p>All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better</p>\n<p>他们只需少量的资金就能更快地，更好地拥有</p>\n<p>was a little bit of capital.</p>\n<p>他们理想的生活</p>\n<p>It was an amazing sort of insight for me.</p>\n<p>这对我来说是一个令人惊叹的见解</p>\n<p>And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --</p>\n<p>事实上，我被这个见解真真的打动了</p>\n<p>it's hard to express now how much that affected me --</p>\n<p>很难表达这个观点对我有多大的影响</p>\n<p>but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,</p>\n<p>不论如何，我确实被打动了。我也的确在几周后放弃了我的工作</p>\n<p>and I moved to East Africa</p>\n<p>继而搬迁到了东非</p>\n<p>to try to see for myself what this was about.</p>\n<p>就是想亲自看看情况</p>\n<p>For the first time, actually, in a long time</p>\n<p>这么长时间里，这是确实是第一次，</p>\n<p>I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,</p>\n<p>我想见到这些人，我想去见这些企业家</p>\n<p>and see for myself what their lives were actually about.</p>\n<p>并亲自看看他们真实的生活</p>\n<p>So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania</p>\n<p>因此，我在肯尼亚，乌干达，坦桑尼亚呆了3个月</p>\n<p>interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars</p>\n<p>和那些企业家们进行了交流</p>\n<p>to start or grow a business.</p>\n<p>就是用100美元贷款创业或者拓展业务的企业家们</p>\n<p>And in fact, through those interactions,</p>\n<p>事实上，通过这些交流</p>\n<p>for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends</p>\n<p>我第一次开始和这些各色各样的</p>\n<p>with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there</p>\n<p>原先本来远离我的</p>\n<p>that was supposed to be far away.</p>\n<p>人们成了朋友</p>\n<p>I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.</p>\n<p>我开始不断地交朋友</p>\n<p>And over and over again,</p>\n<p>并了解到他们的个人生活</p>\n<p>as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,</p>\n<p>我和他们交谈并且他们在一起待几天</p>\n<p>I did hear stories of life change</p>\n<p>我的确听到了他们生活改变的故事</p>\n<p>and amazing little details of change.</p>\n<p>以及那些令人惊叹的生活细节改变</p>\n<p>So I would hear from goat herders</p>\n<p>因此，我希望能够听到</p>\n<p>who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.</p>\n<p>那些牧羊人能够用他们得到的贷款去买更多的山羊</p>\n<p>Their business trajectory would change.</p>\n<p>他们的商业轨迹改变了</p>\n<p>They would make a little bit more money;</p>\n<p>他们能够赚更多的钱</p>\n<p>their standard of living</p>\n<p>他们的生活质量</p>\n<p>would shift and would get better.</p>\n<p>改变了，并变的更好了</p>\n<p>And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,</p>\n<p>他们能够对他们的生活做些细小的但卓有意义的调整</p>\n<p>like they would start to send their children to school.</p>\n<p>比如，他们可以开始把他们的孩子送去学校</p>\n<p>They might be able to buy mosquito nets.</p>\n<p>他们可以买蚊帐</p>\n<p>Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.</p>\n<p>也许他们可以买得起一个门锁让他们感到更安全</p>\n<p>Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea</p>\n<p>也许，仅仅是他们可以在他们的茶里放糖</p>\n<p>and offer that to me when I came as their guest</p>\n<p>当我做客时来款待我</p>\n<p>and that made them feel proud.</p>\n<p>这让他们感到自豪</p>\n<p>But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,</p>\n<p>即使我和20个不同的牧羊人聊天，也会有很多美丽的细节。</p>\n<p>and some days that's what happened --</p>\n<p>相信总有一天</p>\n<p>these beautiful details of life change</p>\n<p>这些美丽的令生活改变的细节</p>\n<p>that were meaningful to them.</p>\n<p>对他们来说是意义非凡的</p>\n<p>That was another thing that really touched me.</p>\n<p>这是另一个令我触动的事情</p>\n<p>It was really humbling to see for the first time,</p>\n<p>这是我第一次谦虚的感受到</p>\n<p>to really understand</p>\n<p>以至于确实懂得</p>\n<p>that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,</p>\n<p>即使我会用魔法棒并能够修好所有东西</p>\n<p>I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.</p>\n<p>但是我也很有可能把事情搞砸</p>\n<p>Because the best way for people to change their lives</p>\n<p>因为让人们改变生活的最好的方式</p>\n<p>is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.</p>\n<p>就是让他们自己去控制并按照他们自己认为最佳的方式进行</p>\n<p>So I saw that and it was very humbling.</p>\n<p>我看到了这一点，我感到那是很震撼人心的</p>\n<p>Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.</p>\n<p>此外，还有一件事情很有意思</p>\n<p>I never once was asked for a donation,</p>\n<p>我从未被要求捐助</p>\n<p>which had kind of been my mode, right.</p>\n<p>这似乎是我的作风，是吧？</p>\n<p>There's poverty, you give money to help --</p>\n<p>这里有贫困，你该给予金钱的帮助</p>\n<p>no one asked me for a donation.</p>\n<p>没有人请求我来捐款</p>\n<p>In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.</p>\n<p>事实上，没有人想让我怜悯他们</p>\n<p>If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already</p>\n<p>他们只是想把自己的事业做得更好</p>\n<p>and to build on their own capabilities.</p>\n<p>同时加强他们自己的能力</p>\n<p>So what I did hear, once in a while,</p>\n<p>因此，我一直听到的是</p>\n<p>was that people wanted a loan --</p>\n<p>人们需要贷款</p>\n<p>I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.</p>\n<p>我认为这听起来很合理并真的很令人激动</p>\n<p>And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,</p>\n<p>顺便说一下，我在大学里学的是哲学和诗歌</p>\n<p>so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.</p>\n<p>因此我在东非时并不懂利润和销售的区别</p>\n<p>I just got this impression that the money would work.</p>\n<p>我留下的印象是，钱就可以帮助他们</p>\n<p>And my introduction to business</p>\n<p>我的业务开端</p>\n<p>was in these $100 little infuses of capital.</p>\n<p>就是这些100美元的资金注入</p>\n<p>And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,</p>\n<p>我学到了利润，销售，杠杆和相关的知识</p>\n<p>from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.</p>\n<p>从农民，缝纫女工，牧羊人那里</p>\n<p>So this idea</p>\n<p>将这个想法</p>\n<p>that these new stories of business and hope</p>\n<p>这些商业和希望的新奇故事</p>\n<p>might be shared with my friends and family,</p>\n<p>和我的朋友和家人分享</p>\n<p>and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed</p>\n<p>以此，我们就能够得到他们需要的钱</p>\n<p>to be able to continue their businesses as loans,</p>\n<p>这些钱作为贷款让他们继续他们的事业</p>\n<p>that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.</p>\n<p>就是这样的一个点子变成了Kiva</p>\n<p>A few months later, I went back to Uganda</p>\n<p>几个月之后，我回到了乌干达</p>\n<p>with a digital camera and a basic website</p>\n<p>带着数码相机和一个很简单的网站</p>\n<p>that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,</p>\n<p>我和我的合作伙伴，Matthew一起做的</p>\n<p>and took pictures of seven of my new friends,</p>\n<p>然后给我的七个新朋友照了些照片</p>\n<p>posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,</p>\n<p>并在网上贴出了他们的创业故事</p>\n<p>spammed friends and family and said, \"We think this is legal.</p>\n<p>随后疯狂地给朋友和家人发，并声称“我们没犯法”</p>\n<p>Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,</p>\n<p>虽然还没有从证监会那里得到反馈</p>\n<p>but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,</p>\n<p>但是你觉得怎么样，想参与下么？</p>\n<p>provide the money that they need?\"</p>\n<p>给需要钱的人提供资金?</p>\n<p>The money came in basically overnight.</p>\n<p>这些钱当天晚上就发过来了</p>\n<p>We sent it over to Uganda.</p>\n<p>我们就发给乌干达</p>\n<p>And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;</p>\n<p>六个月之后，美妙是事情发生了</p>\n<p>the entrepreneurs received the money,</p>\n<p>这些企业家支付了他们的借款</p>\n<p>they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,</p>\n<p>同时他们的事业也蒸蒸日上</p>\n<p>and they were able to support themselves</p>\n<p>他们能够丰衣足食了</p>\n<p>and change the trajectory of their lives.</p>\n<p>他们的生活轨迹改变了</p>\n<p>In October of '05,</p>\n<p>2005年十月份</p>\n<p>after those first seven loans were paid,</p>\n<p>在这七笔贷款都返还后</p>\n<p>Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.</p>\n<p>Matt和我取消了网页上的beta标志(测试期)</p>\n<p>We said, \"Our little experiment has been a success.</p>\n<p>我们认为：这个小测验取得了成功</p>\n<p>Let's start for real.\" That was our official launch.</p>\n<p>我们开始正式运营这个网站</p>\n<p>And then that first year, October '05 through '06,</p>\n<p>在这之后的第一年，即2005年十月至2006年十月</p>\n<p>Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.</p>\n<p>Kiva协助了50万美元的贷款</p>\n<p>The second year, it was a total of 15 million.</p>\n<p>第二年，总额变成了1500万美元</p>\n<p>The third year, the total was up to around 40.</p>\n<p>第三年，到了4000万</p>\n<p>The fourth year, we were just short of 100.</p>\n<p>第四年，差不多1个亿了</p>\n<p>And today, less than five years in,</p>\n<p>至今，不到五年时间里</p>\n<p>Kiva's facilitated</p>\n<p>Kiva协助了</p>\n<p>more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,</p>\n<p>超过1.5亿美元的贷款，这可都是一个个25美元积累出来的哦</p>\n<p>from lenders and entrepreneurs --</p>\n<p>这些钱来自放贷人和企业家们</p>\n<p>more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.</p>\n<p>他们来自世界200个国家</p>\n<p>So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.</p>\n<p>这就是你今天看到的Kiva</p>\n<p>And while those numbers and those statistics</p>\n<p>这些数字和统计结果</p>\n<p>are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,</p>\n<p>对我来说很有趣也很有意思</p>\n<p>to me, Kiva's really about stories.</p>\n<p>对我来说，Kiva充满了故事</p>\n<p>It's about retelling</p>\n<p>它重述着</p>\n<p>the story of the poor,</p>\n<p>穷人的故事</p>\n<p>and it's about giving ourselves</p>\n<p>以及给他们</p>\n<p>an opportunity to engage</p>\n<p>一个机会来积极参与并承担责任</p>\n<p>that validates their dignity,</p>\n<p>这证明了他们的尊严</p>\n<p>validates a partnership relationship,</p>\n<p>证明了一种合作的关系</p>\n<p>not a relationship that's based</p>\n<p>而不是以前那种基于</p>\n<p>on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary</p>\n<p>捐款人和受款人</p>\n<p>weirdness that can happen.</p>\n<p>那种古怪的关系</p>\n<p>But instead a relationship that can promote respect</p>\n<p>现在的这种合作关系促进了尊敬</p>\n<p>and hope</p>\n<p>和希望</p>\n<p>and this optimism</p>\n<p>还有就是这种乐观向上的精神</p>\n<p>that together we can move forward.</p>\n<p>让我们携手共进</p>\n<p>So what I hope is that,</p>\n<p>我希望</p>\n<p>not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --</p>\n<p>这些钱不仅能够通过Kiva流动</p>\n<p>that's a very positive and meaningful thing --</p>\n<p>那是非常积极的和有意义的事情</p>\n<p>but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,</p>\n<p>而且我希望Kiva能够模糊</p>\n<p>between the traditional rich and poor categories</p>\n<p>传统的富裕和贫穷之间的界限</p>\n<p>that we're taught to see in the world,</p>\n<p>也就是我们小时候所认为的世界</p>\n<p>this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.</p>\n<p>这个错误的二分法将世界分隔成我们和他们， 有产和无产</p>\n<p>I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.</p>\n<p>我希望Kiva能够模糊这种界限</p>\n<p>Because as that happens,</p>\n<p>因为，当其发生时</p>\n<p>I think we can feel free to interact</p>\n<p>我想我们能够自由地交流</p>\n<p>in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,</p>\n<p>以更开放，更公正，更有创造力的方式</p>\n<p>to engage with each other and to help each other.</p>\n<p>来相互激励，相互帮助</p>\n<p>Imagine how you feel</p>\n<p>想象一下你的感觉</p>\n<p>when you see somebody on street who is begging</p>\n<p>当你看到一个人在街上乞讨时</p>\n<p>and you're about to approach them.</p>\n<p>而你又向他走去</p>\n<p>Imagine how you feel;</p>\n<p>想象一下你自己的感觉</p>\n<p>and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody</p>\n<p>这个人的不同的情形</p>\n<p>who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work</p>\n<p>这个人的创业故事和他所做的努力</p>\n<p>who wants to tell you about their business.</p>\n<p>这个人期望谈论他们的事业</p>\n<p>Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.</p>\n<p>他们微笑着谈论他们的成就</p>\n<p>Imagine if you're speaking with somebody</p>\n<p>试想，如果你正在</p>\n<p>who's growing things and making them flourish,</p>\n<p>事业蓬勃向上的人交谈</p>\n<p>somebody who's using their talents</p>\n<p>某人用他的智慧</p>\n<p>to do something productive,</p>\n<p>卓有成效地工作</p>\n<p>somebody who's built their own business from scratch,</p>\n<p>某人从零开始创业</p>\n<p>someone who is surrounded by abundance,</p>\n<p>他能够丰衣足食</p>\n<p>not scarcity,</p>\n<p>并远离贫穷</p>\n<p>who's in fact creating abundance,</p>\n<p>他确实在创造富足</p>\n<p>somebody with full hands with something to offer,</p>\n<p>他手上有东西可以奉献</p>\n<p>not empty hands</p>\n<p>而不是两手空空地</p>\n<p>asking for you to give them something.</p>\n<p>向你索要东西</p>\n<p>Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect</p>\n<p>试想，如果你能够听到你期望听到的故事</p>\n<p>of somebody who wakes up every day</p>\n<p>某人每天起床</p>\n<p>and works very, very hard to make their life better.</p>\n<p>工作努力，生活蒸蒸日上</p>\n<p>These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.</p>\n<p>这些故事确实能够改变我们思考对方的方式</p>\n<p>And if we can catalyze</p>\n<p>如果我们能催化出</p>\n<p>a supportive community to come around these individuals</p>\n<p>一个支持性的社区来帮助这些人</p>\n<p>and to participate in their story</p>\n<p>来参与他们的故事</p>\n<p>by lending a little bit of money,</p>\n<p>给他们提供一点钱</p>\n<p>I think that can change the way we believe in each other</p>\n<p>我想那就能改变我们互信的方式</p>\n<p>and each other's potential.</p>\n<p>以及相互的潜力</p>\n<p>Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.</p>\n<p>现在对我来说，Kiva只是刚刚开始</p>\n<p>And as I look forward to what is next,</p>\n<p>当我寻找下一个目标时</p>\n<p>it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.</p>\n<p>我至今学到的这些是非常有帮助的</p>\n<p>The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.</p>\n<p>第一就是，我所提到的，创业是新观点</p>\n<p>Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,</p>\n<p>Kiva的借款人，在我和他们交谈时，在我了解他们几年后</p>\n<p>have taught me what entrepreneurship is.</p>\n<p>他们教会我什么是创业</p>\n<p>And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.</p>\n<p>我认为，它的核心是一种让生活更美好的决心</p>\n<p>You see an opportunity</p>\n<p>你看到了机会</p>\n<p>and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.</p>\n<p>你决定去做些什么来把握机会</p>\n<p>In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today</p>\n<p>即，明天会更好</p>\n<p>and going after that.</p>\n<p>并持续这种信念</p>\n<p>Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.</p>\n<p>第二件事就是，这些贷款是很有意思的交流工具</p>\n<p>So they're not a donation.</p>\n<p>他们不是为了捐款</p>\n<p>Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.</p>\n<p>是的，好像听起来差不多</p>\n<p>But in fact, when you give something to someone</p>\n<p>但事实上，当你给予时</p>\n<p>and they say, \"Thanks,\" and let you know how things go,</p>\n<p>他们说谢谢并告诉你事情的发展</p>\n<p>that's one thing.</p>\n<p>那仅是一方面</p>\n<p>When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,</p>\n<p>当你借钱时，他们慢慢地还钱</p>\n<p>you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.</p>\n<p>你有了借口来持续对话</p>\n<p>This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --</p>\n<p>这种持续性的关注，不断发展的关注</p>\n<p>is a really big deal</p>\n<p>才是至关重要的</p>\n<p>to build different kinds of relationships among us.</p>\n<p>这建立起我们之间的各种不同的关系</p>\n<p>And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,</p>\n<p>第三，我从这些企业家那里学到了我该知道的东西</p>\n<p>when all else is equal,</p>\n<p>在同等情况下</p>\n<p>given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,</p>\n<p>一个选择是仅仅给他们钱，让他们做他们需要做的事情</p>\n<p>or money plus the support and encouragement</p>\n<p>另一个选择是钱以及来自全球的</p>\n<p>of a global community,</p>\n<p>支持和鼓励</p>\n<p>people choose the community plus the money.</p>\n<p>人们选择的是第二个</p>\n<p>That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.</p>\n<p>这是一个更加有意义的组合，更有力量的组合</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, this particular incident</p>\n<p>有了那样的想法，这特别的需求</p>\n<p>has led to the things that I'm working on now.</p>\n<p>引导出了我现在所做的</p>\n<p>I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.</p>\n<p>我看到了各个地方的企业家们，是我乐于看到的</p>\n<p>And one thing that I've seen</p>\n<p>我还看到了一件事</p>\n<p>is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.</p>\n<p>世界上已经有很多支持性社区存在了</p>\n<p>With social networks,</p>\n<p>通过社交网络</p>\n<p>it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us</p>\n<p>一种令人惊奇的方式，让和我们有共同目标的人的数量</p>\n<p>in our own supportive communities, rapidly.</p>\n<p>在我们的支持性社区里迅速增长</p>\n<p>And so, as I have been thinking about this,</p>\n<p>也因此，我曾想过这些</p>\n<p>I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities</p>\n<p>我一直在想，如何我们能够激励这些支持性社区</p>\n<p>to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas</p>\n<p>去催化更多的创业点子</p>\n<p>and to catalyze all of us</p>\n<p>去催化更多像我们一样的人</p>\n<p>to make tomorrow better than today?</p>\n<p>让明天更美好呢</p>\n<p>As I've researched what's going on in the United States,</p>\n<p>我研究了一些在美国发生的事情</p>\n<p>a few interesting little insights have come up.</p>\n<p>几个很有意思的事情</p>\n<p>So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,</p>\n<p>其中一个是，当然，众望所归</p>\n<p>many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world</p>\n<p>很多美国的和世界范围内的小企业</p>\n<p>still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do</p>\n<p>仍旧需要资金来成长和扩张</p>\n<p>or they might need money during a hard month.</p>\n<p>或者他们需要资金度过某个艰难时期</p>\n<p>But there's always a need for resources close by.</p>\n<p>对资源的需求总是存在的</p>\n<p>Another thing is, it turns out,</p>\n<p>但是</p>\n<p>those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --</p>\n<p>这些资源通常不是来源于你所期望的地方</p>\n<p>banks, venture capitalists,</p>\n<p>比如银行，风投</p>\n<p>other organizations and support structures --</p>\n<p>或者一些组织和支持性结构</p>\n<p>they come from friends and family.</p>\n<p>这些资源来自于朋友和家庭</p>\n<p>Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses</p>\n<p>一些数据显示85%或更多的小企业的资金</p>\n<p>comes from friends and family.</p>\n<p>来源于朋友和家庭</p>\n<p>That's around 130 billion dollars a year --</p>\n<p>每年大概有1300亿美元</p>\n<p>it's a lot.</p>\n<p>很多啊</p>\n<p>And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,</p>\n<p>第三，对于这些从朋友和家庭来筹集资金的人们</p>\n<p>it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,</p>\n<p>是很尴尬的，他们不知道怎么开口</p>\n<p>how to ask, what to promise in return,</p>\n<p>也不知道怎么来担保回报</p>\n<p>even though they have the best of intentions</p>\n<p>即使他们有最佳的计划</p>\n<p>and want to thank those people that are supporting them.</p>\n<p>并想感谢这些帮助他们的人们</p>\n<p>So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way</p>\n<p>因此，以一种全新的方式来使用支持性社区的力量</p>\n<p>and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves</p>\n<p>并让企业家自己去决定</p>\n<p>exactly what that financial exchange should look like,</p>\n<p>是什么样的金融交易的方式</p>\n<p>exactly what fits them and the people around them,</p>\n<p>以及他们所适合的和他们周围的人</p>\n<p>this week actually,</p>\n<p>事实上，这周</p>\n<p>we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,</p>\n<p>我们低调地启动了Profounder</p>\n<p>which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need</p>\n<p>一个“众筹”平台让他们朋友和家人投资</p>\n<p>through investments from their friends and family.</p>\n<p>这些小企业</p>\n<p>And it's investments, not donations, not loans,</p>\n<p>这些投资不是捐款，也不是贷款</p>\n<p>but investments that have a dynamic return.</p>\n<p>而是具有动态回报的投资</p>\n<p>So the mapping of participating in the story,</p>\n<p>这个“故事”的映射</p>\n<p>it actually flows with the up and down.</p>\n<p>事实上，时上时下</p>\n<p>So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool</p>\n<p>基本上，这是一个自己动手的工具</p>\n<p>for small businesses to raise these funds.</p>\n<p>用于小企业融资</p>\n<p>And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,</p>\n<p>你所要做的就是浏览这个网站，然后建立主页</p>\n<p>create investment terms in a really easy way.</p>\n<p>以简单明了的方式建立投资条款</p>\n<p>We make it really, really simple for me</p>\n<p>我们要让它简明扼要</p>\n<p>as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.</p>\n<p>也让其他用这个网站的人觉得简明扼要</p>\n<p>And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.</p>\n<p>我们允许创业者分享一定百分比的销售额</p>\n<p>They can raise up to a million dollars</p>\n<p>他们可以融资上百万美元</p>\n<p>from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --</p>\n<p>从无限的，未认证的，投资理念简单的投资者那里</p>\n<p>everyday people, heaven forbid --</p>\n<p>--都是些普通的投资者嘛，上帝会允许滴--</p>\n<p>and they can share those returns over time --</p>\n<p>他们能够分享回报</p>\n<p>again, whatever terms they set.</p>\n<p>不论什么他们设置的什么条款</p>\n<p>As investors choose to become involved</p>\n<p>当投资者参与其中时</p>\n<p>based on those terms,</p>\n<p>基于这些条款</p>\n<p>they can either take their rewards back as cash,</p>\n<p>他们能够得到现金回报</p>\n<p>or they can decide in advance</p>\n<p>或者他们可以提前决定</p>\n<p>to give those returns away to a non-profit.</p>\n<p>将这些回报送给非盈利组织</p>\n<p>So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.</p>\n<p>因此，他们可以做现金投资者或者非现金回报投资者</p>\n<p>It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea</p>\n<p>我的希望是这类的工具能给任何有帮助别人想法人们</p>\n<p>a path to go do what they want to do in the world</p>\n<p>一条途径去做他们想做的</p>\n<p>and to gather the people around them that they already have,</p>\n<p>凝聚他们周围的人</p>\n<p>the people that know them best</p>\n<p>这些最了解的他们人</p>\n<p>and that love them and want to support them,</p>\n<p>爱他们的以及想帮助他们的人</p>\n<p>to gather them to make this happen.</p>\n<p>大家一起将梦想变成现实</p>\n<p>So that's what I'm working on now.</p>\n<p>那就是我现在做的</p>\n<p>And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.</p>\n<p>更进一步，我就想说，看看这些工具</p>\n<p>Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,</p>\n<p>现在，Profounder才刚刚开始</p>\n<p>and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.</p>\n<p>它是可以触及的，是清楚的。它就是一根血管，一个工具</p>\n<p>What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,</p>\n<p>我们需要人们的关注并去使用它</p>\n<p>just like they've cared enough to use Kiva</p>\n<p>就想他们关注并使用Kiva一样</p>\n<p>to make those connections.</p>\n<p>来连接彼此</p>\n<p>But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --</p>\n<p>好消息是我不认为我站在这里是想说服你们，去关注</p>\n<p>I'm not even going to try.</p>\n<p>我根本不想尝试</p>\n<p>I don't think, even though we often hear,</p>\n<p>我不认为，即使我们经常听到</p>\n<p>you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,</p>\n<p>那些道德和品质的原因</p>\n<p>the religious reasons,</p>\n<p>还有宗教的原因</p>\n<p>\"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.\"</p>\n<p>比如，这就是为什么关心和给予让你感到幸福之类的</p>\n<p>I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;</p>\n<p>我不需要去解释，你们懂的。</p>\n<p>in fact, I think we know so much,</p>\n<p>事实上，我想我们非常了解</p>\n<p>and it's such a reality</p>\n<p>现实</p>\n<p>that we care so deeply,</p>\n<p>我们很关心的现实</p>\n<p>that in fact, what usually stops us</p>\n<p>实际上，通常让我们停下来的</p>\n<p>is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,</p>\n<p>是我们害怕尝试害怕失败</p>\n<p>because we care so very much about helping each other</p>\n<p>因为我们太关心彼此</p>\n<p>and being meaningful in each other's lives.</p>\n<p>想在彼此的生活中做些有意义的事情</p>\n<p>So what I think I can do today,</p>\n<p>我想我今天能做的</p>\n<p>that best thing I can give you --</p>\n<p>就是给你讲述</p>\n<p>I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.</p>\n<p>我的故事，我已尽我所能了</p>\n<p>And I think I can remind us that we do care.</p>\n<p>我想提醒大家我们真的很在乎</p>\n<p>I think we all already know that.</p>\n<p>我们都很清楚</p>\n<p>And I think we know that love is resilient enough</p>\n<p>我想我们明白爱是足够坚韧的</p>\n<p>for us to get out there and try.</p>\n<p>让我们尽可能的去尝试</p>\n<p>Just a sec.</p>\n<p>稍等（感动啊~~）</p>\n<p>(Applause)</p>\n<p>（掌声）</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>谢谢</p>\n<p>(Applause)</p>\n<p>（掌声）</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>谢谢</p>\n<p>(Applause)</p>\n<p>（掌声）</p>\n<p>For me, the best way to be inspired to try</p>\n<p>对我来说，最好的激励自己去尝试的方法就是</p>\n<p>is to stop and to listen</p>\n<p>停下来并倾听</p>\n<p>to someone else's story.</p>\n<p>别人的故事</p>\n<p>And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.</p>\n<p>在此，我很感谢TED让我站在这里</p>\n<p>And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,</p>\n<p>我同时感激无论何时</p>\n<p>guaranteed, I am inspired --</p>\n<p>我保证，我都是倍受激励的</p>\n<p>I am inspired by the person I am listening to.</p>\n<p>我被那些有故事的人激励着</p>\n<p>And I believe more and more every time I listen</p>\n<p>每次我倾听他们的故事，我都会越来越相信</p>\n<p>in that that person's potential to do great things in the world</p>\n<p>对这个世界所做的伟大的贡献的人</p>\n<p>and in my own potential to maybe help.</p>\n<p>和我自己所提供的帮助</p>\n<p>And that --</p>\n<p>因此</p>\n<p>forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --</p>\n<p>忘了那些工具吧，忘了移动那些资源</p>\n<p>that stuff's easy.</p>\n<p>它们都不算什么</p>\n<p>Believing in each other,</p>\n<p>相信彼此</p>\n<p>really being sure when push comes to shove</p>\n<p>才是真正的价值</p>\n<p>that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,</p>\n<p>我们每一个人都能为这个世界出一把力</p>\n<p>that is what can make our stories into love stories</p>\n<p>那才是将故事变成爱的原因</p>\n<p>and our collective story</p>\n<p>以及把最后的故事</p>\n<p>into one that continually perpetuates hope</p>\n<p>变成一个持续永恒的希望</p>\n<p>and good things for all of us.</p>\n<p>和对我们都有益的事业</p>\n<p>So that, this belief in each other,</p>\n<p>因此，相信彼此</p>\n<p>knowing that without a doubt</p>\n<p>执此信念，坚定不移</p>\n<p>and practicing that every day in whatever you do,</p>\n<p>不论你做什么，都积极地实践这种信念</p>\n<p>that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.</p>\n<p>我相信这种信念终将改变世界并让明天更美好</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>谢谢大家</p>\n<p>(Applause)</p>\n<p>（掌声）</p>\n<p><strong>2013/5/1

much.\n\n非常重要\n\nThe stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.\n\n我们谈论与自己生活相关故事是有意义的\n\nAnd most of all,\n\n而我认为最重要的是\n\nI think the way that we participate in each other's stories\n\n我们参与到他人故事的方式\n\nis of deep importance.\n\n才是至关重要的\n\nI was six years old\n\n我六岁时\n\nwhen I first heard stories about the poor.\n\n当我第一次听到关于穷人的故事的时候\n\nNow I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,\n\n我并没有直接从穷人口中听到这些故事\n\nI heard them from my Sunday school teacher\n\n我从教堂周日学校的老师那里听到这些故事\n\nand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.\n\n和耶稣，也就是这些老师那里\n\nI remember learning that people who were poor\n\n我记得我学到了穷人\n\nneeded something material --\n\n需要物质帮助\n\nfood, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.\n\n如食物，衣服，住处，那些他们没有的\n\nAnd I also was taught, coupled with that,\n\n我还学到了\n\nthat it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --\n\n我们这些五六岁的孩子应该做的是\n\nit was our job, apparently, to help.\n\n很明显，去帮助\n\nThis is what Jesus asked of us.\n\n这也是耶稣需要我们做的\n\nAnd then he said, \"What you do for the least of these, you do for me.\"\n\n他还说，你为他们做的就是为我做的\n\nNow I was pretty psyched.\n\n现在， 我被极大的鼓舞了\n\nI was very eager to be useful in the world --\n\n我非常热切地希望自己能向世界证明自己的意义\n\nI think we all have that feeling.\n\n相信我们都有这样的感觉\n\nAnd also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.\n\n此外，有意思的是上帝也需要帮助\n\nThat was news to me,\n\n那对我来说真是个新闻\n\nand it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.\n\n而且，这是貌似一个很重要的事情值得我们参与\n\nBut I also learned very soon thereafter\n\n但是自从耶稣说了那句话之后，我也很快地理解了耶稣所说\n\nthat Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,\n\n那我同时将其释义为\n\nthe poor would always be with us.\n\n贫穷和我们同在\n\nThis frustrated and confused me;\n\n这让我沮丧和迷惑\n\nI felt like I had been just given a homework assignment\n\n我感觉我被安排了一个\n\nthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,\n\n不得不做的同时令人振奋的作业\n\nbut no matter what I would do, I would fail.\n\n但是不论我做什么，我都会失败\n\nSo I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,\n\n因此我感到迷茫，有点郁闷以及恼怒\n\nlike maybe I'd misunderstood something here.\n\n好像我似乎误解了这里的一些东西\n\nAnd I felt overwhelmed.\n\n同时我感到了压力\n\nAnd for the first time,\n\n这也是第一次\n\nI began to fear this group of people\n\n我开始害怕一类人群\n\nand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.\n\n并对这一人群有负面的情绪\n\nI imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals\n\n我的脑袋里呈现出这些人组成的长队\n\nthat were never going away, that would always be with us.\n\n这个长队将一直伴随我们，永不会离去\n\nThey were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,\n\n他们会总是不停地要求我的帮助，要求我给他们东西\n\nwhich I was excited to do,\n\n这些虽然都是我喜欢做的\n\nbut I didn't know how it was going to work.\n\n但是我并不知道将来会发生什么\n\nAnd I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,\n\n我不知道但我无物可给的时候将会发生什么\n\nespecially if the problem was never going away.\n\n特别是这个问题永远不会离去\n\nIn the years following,\n\n几年之后\n\nthe other stories I heard about the poor growing up\n\n我听到一些其他的故事关于减贫\n\nwere no more positive.\n\n并不是那么积极\n\nFor example, I saw pictures and images\n\n例如，我曾经看到了令人悲伤和苦恼的\n\nfrequently of sadness and suffering.\n\n一些照片和图像\n\nI heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.\n\n我听到穷人生活的不尽如人意\n\nI heard about disease, I heard about war --\n\n关于疾病，关于战争\n\nthey always seemed to be kind of related.\n\n似乎这些都是和贫穷相关联的\n\nAnd in general,\n\n总的来说\n\nI got this sort of idea\n\n我有个这样的想法\n\nthat the poor in the world lived lives\n\n穷人生活的世界\n\nthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,\n\n充满悲伤，充满苦闷\n\ndevastation, hopelessness.\n\n充满破坏，充满绝望\n\nAnd after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,\n\n在那之后，我想到我们大家的感觉\n\nis this predictable response,\n\n就是这个可预知的回应\n\nwhere I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.\n\n当我每次听到穷人时，我开始感觉不舒服\n\nI started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,\n\n由于我的相对富裕让我开始感觉到罪恶\n\nbecause I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.\n\n很明显的是因为我没有尽我所能把事情做得更好\n\nAnd I even felt a sense of shame because of that.\n\n因此，我感到羞愧\n\nAnd so naturally,\n\n自然地\n\nI started to distance myself.\n\n我开始疏远我自己\n\nI stopped listening to their stories\n\n我不再像以前一样细心地倾听\n\nquite as closely as I had before.\n\n他们的故事\n\nAnd I stopped expecting things to really change.\n\n我不再期望事情能真正有所改变\n\nNow I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.\n\n我还是会给予。表面看来，我似乎还在继续参与\n\nI gave of my time and my money,\n\n给予我的时间和金钱\n\nI gave when solutions were on sale.\n\n我给予的都是廉价的方案\n\nThe cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.\n\n一杯咖啡就是救一个孩子的命，是这样的\n\nI mean who can argue with that?\n\n我的意思是谁能说那是错的呢？\n\nI gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid\n\n当我无路可退时，当我难以推辞时，我才给予\n\nand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough\n\n总体来说，负面情绪驱使我给予\n\nthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,\n\n我的给予是为了减轻我自己的烦恼\n\nnot someone else's.\n\n而不是其他人的\n\nThe truth be told, I was giving out of that place,\n\n确实，我离开了那里地方\n\nnot out of a genuine place of hope\n\n但我并没有远离希望之地\n\nand excitement to help and of generosity.\n\n没有远离帮助他人和慷慨解囊的兴奋\n\nIt became a transaction for me,\n\n它变成了我的一个转折点\n\nbecame sort of a trade.\n\n变成了一种交易\n\nI was purchasing something --\n\n我是在购买什么东西\n\nI was buying my right to go on with my day\n\n我是在购买我继续生存\n\nand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.\n\n且不被这些糟糕新闻烦恼的权利\n\nAnd I think the way that we go through that sometimes\n\n我认为我们采用的这种方法，有时候\n\ncan, first of all,\n\n首先能够\n\ndisembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.\n\n让一部分人或者一些个体灵魂出窍\n\nAnd it can also turn into a commodity,\n\n这种想法也能够变成一种商品\n\nwhich is a very scary thing.\n\n一种令人恐怖的东西\n\nSo as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,\n\n就是正如我所说所想\n\nwe kind of buy our distance,\n\n我们好像在购买我们之间的距离\n\nwe kind of buy our right to go on with our day.\n\n我们好像在购买我们继续生活的权利\n\nI think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.\n\n我想这种交易事实上阻碍了我们得到我们最想得到的东西\n\nIt can get in the way of our desire\n\n阻碍了我们的愿望\n\nto really be meaningful and useful in another person's life\n\n就是给予对他人真正有意义和有用的东西\n\nand, in short to love.\n\n即，去爱\n\nThankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me\n\n欣慰地是，几年之后，我被改变了\n\nbecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\n因为我听了穆罕默德·尤努斯博士的演讲\n\nI know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,\n\n在座大部分人也许知道他是谁\n\nbut to give the shorthand version\n\n但我还是想给没有听说过他的人\n\nfor any who have not heard him speak,\n\n做个简短的叙述\n\nDr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago\n\n尤努斯博士在几年前获得了诺贝尔和平奖\n\nfor his work pioneering modern microfinance.\n\n因为他在现代微金融领域所做的先驱工作\n\nWhen I heard him speak, it was three years before that.\n\n在他获得诺贝尔和平奖三年之前，我就听了他的演讲\n\nBut basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --\n\n如果你对微金融是陌生的，基本上，它可以\n\nthink of that as financial services for the poor.\n\n理解为给穷人提供的金融服务\n\nThink of all the things you get at your bank\n\n就是，所有你在银行里\n\nand imagine those products and services\n\n可以获得的以及可以想到的\n\ntailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.\n\n针对每天只有几美元生活费的人所提供的产品和服务\n\nDr. Yunus shared his story,\n\n尤努斯博士分享了他的故事\n\nexplaining what that was,\n\n阐述了事情的原貌\n\nand what he had done with his Grameen Bank.\n\n以及他和他的格莱珉银行所做到的\n\nHe also talked about, in particular, microlending,\n\n他也讲到了，特别是，微信贷\n\nwhich is a tiny loan\n\n即，能够帮助人们创业和企业发展的\n\nthat could help someone start or grow a business.\n\n微型贷款\n\nNow, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.\n\n他的演讲有如下几点原因让我感到兴奋\n\nFirst and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world\n\n第一，我学到了一种新的方法来改变世界\n\nthat, for once, showed me, maybe,\n\n其曾经向我展示了\n\na way to interact with someone\n\n一种和他人互动的方式\n\nand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird\n\n并且给出一种让人不感到怪异的分享资源的方式\n\nand didn't make me feel bad --\n\n同时，这种方式不让我感到难堪\n\nthat was exciting.\n\n很不错\n\nBut more importantly, he told stories about the poor\n\n但更重要的是，他讲述关于穷人的故事\n\nthat were different than any stories I had heard before.\n\n和我以前听到的故事有很多不同\n\nIn fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.\n\n事实上，以前听到的穷人在各方面都是弱势的\n\nHe was talking about strong, smart,\n\n但他所讲的穷人是\n\nhardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day\n\n坚强，聪明，刻苦的企业家们\n\nand were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.\n\n这些企业家起早贪黑，努力地工作为了让他们和他们家人有更好的生活\n\nAll they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better\n\n他们只需少量的资金就能更快地，更好地拥有\n\nwas a little bit of capital.\n\n他们理想的生活\n\nIt was an amazing sort of insight for me.\n\n这对我来说是一个令人惊叹的见解\n\nAnd I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --\n\n事实上，我被这个见解真真的打动了\n\nit's hard to express now how much that affected me --\n\n很难表达这个观点对我有多大的影响\n\nbut I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,\n\n不论如何，我确实被打动了。我也的确在几周后放弃了我的工作\n\nand I moved to East Africa\n\n继而搬迁到了东非\n\nto try to see for myself what this was about.\n\n就是想亲自看看情况\n\nFor the first time, actually, in a long time\n\n这么长时间里，这是确实是第一次，\n\nI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,\n\n我想见到这些人，我想去见这些企业家\n\nand see for myself what their lives were actually about.\n\n并亲自看看他们真实的生活\n\nSo I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania\n\n因此，我在肯尼亚，乌干达，坦桑尼亚呆了3个月\n\ninterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars\n\n和那些企业家们进行了交流\n\nto start or grow a business.\n\n就是用100美元贷款创业或者拓展业务的企业家们\n\nAnd in fact, through those interactions,\n\n事实上，通过这些交流\n\nfor the first time, I was starting to get to be friends\n\n我第一次开始和这些各色各样的\n\nwith some of those people in that big amorphous group out there\n\n原先本来远离我的\n\nthat was supposed to be far away.\n\n人们成了朋友\n\nI was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.\n\n我开始不断地交朋友\n\nAnd over and over again,\n\n并了解到他们的个人生活\n\nas I interviewed them and spent my days with them,\n\n我和他们交谈并且他们在一起待几天\n\nI did hear stories of life change\n\n我的确听到了他们生活改变的故事\n\nand amazing little details of change.\n\n以及那些令人惊叹的生活细节改变\n\nSo I would hear from goat herders\n\n因此，我希望能够听到\n\nwho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.\n\n那些牧羊人能够用他们得到的贷款去买更多的山羊\n\nTheir business trajectory would change.\n\n他们的商业轨迹改变了\n\nThey would make a little bit more money;\n\n他们能够赚更多的钱\n\ntheir standard of living\n\n他们的生活质量\n\nwould shift and would get better.\n\n改变了，并变的更好了\n\nAnd they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,\n\n他们能够对他们的生活做些细小的但卓有意义的调整\n\nlike they would start to send their children to school.\n\n比如，他们可以开始把他们的孩子送去学校\n\nThey might be able to buy mosquito nets.\n\n他们可以买蚊帐\n\nMaybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.\n\n也许他们可以买得起一个门锁让他们感到更安全\n\nMaybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea\n\n也许，仅仅是他们可以在他们的茶里放糖\n\nand offer that to me when I came as their guest\n\n当我做客时来款待我\n\nand that made them feel proud.\n\n这让他们感到自豪\n\nBut there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,\n\n即使我和20个不同的牧羊人聊天，也会有很多美丽的细节。\n\nand some days that's what happened --\n\n相信总有一天\n\nthese beautiful details of life change\n\n这些美丽的令生活改变的细节\n\nthat were meaningful to them.\n\n对他们来说是意义非凡的\n\nThat was another thing that really touched me.\n\n这是另一个令我触动的事情\n\nIt was really humbling to see for the first time,\n\n这是我第一次谦虚的感受到\n\nto really understand\n\n以至于确实懂得\n\nthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,\n\n即使我会用魔法棒并能够修好所有东西\n\nI probably would have gotten a lot wrong.\n\n但是我也很有可能把事情搞砸\n\nBecause the best way for people to change their lives\n\n因为让人们改变生活的最好的方式\n\nis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.\n\n就是让他们自己去控制并按照他们自己认为最佳的方式进行\n\nSo I saw that and it was very humbling.\n\n我看到了这一点，我感到那是很震撼人心的\n\nAnyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.\n\n此外，还有一件事情很有意思\n\nI never once was asked for a donation,\n\n我从未被要求捐助\n\nwhich had kind of been my mode, right.\n\n这似乎是我的作风，是吧？\n\nThere's poverty, you give money to help --\n\n这里有贫困，你该给予金钱的帮助\n\nno one asked me for a donation.\n\n没有人请求我来捐款\n\nIn fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.\n\n事实上，没有人想让我怜悯他们\n\nIf anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already\n\n他们只是想把自己的事业做得更好\n\nand to build on their own capabilities.\n\n同时加强他们自己的能力\n\nSo what I did hear, once in a while,\n\n因此，我一直听到的是\n\nwas that people wanted a loan --\n\n人们需要贷款\n\nI thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.\n\n我认为这听起来很合理并真的很令人激动\n\nAnd by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,\n\n顺便说一下，我在大学里学的是哲学和诗歌\n\nso I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.\n\n因此我在东非时并不懂利润和销售的区别\n\nI just got this impression that the money would work.\n\n我留下的印象是，钱就可以帮助他们\n\nAnd my introduction to business\n\n我的业务开端\n\nwas in these $100 little infuses of capital.\n\n就是这些100美元的资金注入\n\nAnd I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,\n\n我学到了利润，销售，杠杆和相关的知识\n\nfrom farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.\n\n从农民，缝纫女工，牧羊人那里\n\nSo this idea\n\n将这个想法\n\nthat these new stories of business and hope\n\n这些商业和希望的新奇故事\n\nmight be shared with my friends and family,\n\n和我的朋友和家人分享\n\nand through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed\n\n以此，我们就能够得到他们需要的钱\n\nto be able to continue their businesses as loans,\n\n这些钱作为贷款让他们继续他们的事业\n\nthat's this little idea that turned into Kiva.\n\n就是这样的一个点子变成了Kiva\n\nA few months later, I went back to Uganda\n\n几个月之后，我回到了乌干达\n\nwith a digital camera and a basic website\n\n带着数码相机和一个很简单的网站\n\nthat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,\n\n我和我的合作伙伴，Matthew一起做的\n\nand took pictures of seven of my new friends,\n\n然后给我的七个新朋友照了些照片\n\nposted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,\n\n并在网上贴出了他们的创业故事\n\nspammed friends and family and said, \"We think this is legal.\n\n随后疯狂地给朋友和家人发，并声称“我们没犯法”\n\nHaven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,\n\n虽然还没有从证监会那里得到反馈\n\nbut do you say, do you want to help participate in this,\n\n但是你觉得怎么样，想参与下么？\n\nprovide the money that they need?\"\n\n给需要钱的人提供资金?\n\nThe money came in basically overnight.\n\n这些钱当天晚上就发过来了\n\nWe sent it over to Uganda.\n\n我们就发给乌干达\n\nAnd over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;\n\n六个月之后，美妙是事情发生了\n\nthe entrepreneurs received the money,\n\n这些企业家支付了他们的借款\n\nthey were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,\n\n同时他们的事业也蒸蒸日上\n\nand they were able to support themselves\n\n他们能够丰衣足食了\n\nand change the trajectory of their lives.\n\n他们的生活轨迹改变了\n\nIn October of '05,\n\n2005年十月份\n\nafter those first seven loans were paid,\n\n在这七笔贷款都返还后\n\nMatt and I took the word beta off of the site.\n\nMatt和我取消了网页上的beta标志(测试期)\n\nWe said, \"Our little experiment has been a success.\n\n我们认为：这个小测验取得了成功\n\nLet's start for real.\" That was our official launch.\n\n我们开始正式运营这个网站\n\nAnd then that first year, October '05 through '06,\n\n在这之后的第一年，即2005年十月至2006年十月\n\nKiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.\n\nKiva协助了50万美元的贷款\n\nThe second year, it was a total of 15 million.\n\n第二年，总额变成了1500万美元\n\nThe third year, the total was up to around 40.\n\n第三年，到了4000万\n\nThe fourth year, we were just short of 100.\n\n第四年，差不多1个亿了\n\nAnd today, less than five years in,\n\n至今，不到五年时间里\n\nKiva's facilitated\n\nKiva协助了\n\nmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,\n\n超过1.5亿美元的贷款，这可都是一个个25美元积累出来的哦\n\nfrom lenders and entrepreneurs --\n\n这些钱来自放贷人和企业家们\n\nmore than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.\n\n他们来自世界200个国家\n\nSo that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.\n\n这就是你今天看到的Kiva\n\nAnd while those numbers and those statistics\n\n这些数字和统计结果\n\nare really fun to talk about and they're interesting,\n\n对我来说很有趣也很有意思\n\nto me, Kiva's really about stories.\n\n对我来说，Kiva充满了故事\n\nIt's about retelling\n\n它重述着\n\nthe story of the poor,\n\n穷人的故事\n\nand it's about giving ourselves\n\n以及给他们\n\nan opportunity to engage\n\n一个机会来积极参与并承担责任\n\nthat validates their dignity,\n\n这证明了他们的尊严\n\nvalidates a partnership relationship,\n\n证明了一种合作的关系\n\nnot a relationship that's based\n\n而不是以前那种基于\n\non the traditional sort of donor beneficiary\n\n捐款人和受款人\n\nweirdness that can happen.\n\n那种古怪的关系\n\nBut instead a relationship that can promote respect\n\n现在的这种合作关系促进了尊敬\n\nand hope\n\n和希望\n\nand this optimism\n\n还有就是这种乐观向上的精神\n\nthat together we can move forward.\n\n让我们携手共进\n\nSo what I hope is that,\n\n我希望\n\nnot only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --\n\n这些钱不仅能够通过Kiva流动\n\nthat's a very positive and meaningful thing --\n\n那是非常积极的和有意义的事情\n\nbut I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,\n\n而且我希望Kiva能够模糊\n\nbetween the traditional rich and poor categories\n\n传统的富裕和贫穷之间的界限\n\nthat we're taught to see in the world,\n\n也就是我们小时候所认为的世界\n\nthis false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.\n\n这个错误的二分法将世界分隔成我们和他们， 有产和无产\n\nI hope that Kiva can blur those lines.\n\n我希望Kiva能够模糊这种界限\n\nBecause as that happens,\n\n因为，当其发生时\n\nI think we can feel free to interact\n\n我想我们能够自由地交流\n\nin a way that's more open, more just and more creative,\n\n以更开放，更公正，更有创造力的方式\n\nto engage with each other and to help each other.\n\n来相互激励，相互帮助\n\nImagine how you feel\n\n想象一下你的感觉\n\nwhen you see somebody on street who is begging\n\n当你看到一个人在街上乞讨时\n\nand you're about to approach them.\n\n而你又向他走去\n\nImagine how you feel;\n\n想象一下你自己的感觉\n\nand then imagine the difference when you might see somebody\n\n这个人的不同的情形\n\nwho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work\n\n这个人的创业故事和他所做的努力\n\nwho wants to tell you about their business.\n\n这个人期望谈论他们的事业\n\nMaybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.\n\n他们微笑着谈论他们的成就\n\nImagine if you're speaking with somebody\n\n试想，如果你正在\n\nwho's growing things and making them flourish,\n\n事业蓬勃向上的人交谈\n\nsomebody who's using their talents\n\n某人用他的智慧\n\nto do something productive,\n\n卓有成效地工作\n\nsomebody who's built their own business from scratch,\n\n某人从零开始创业\n\nsomeone who is surrounded by abundance,\n\n他能够丰衣足食\n\nnot scarcity,\n\n并远离贫穷\n\nwho's in fact creating abundance,\n\n他确实在创造富足\n\nsomebody with full hands with something to offer,\n\n他手上有东西可以奉献\n\nnot empty hands\n\n而不是两手空空地\n\nasking for you to give them something.\n\n向你索要东西\n\nImagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect\n\n试想，如果你能够听到你期望听到的故事\n\nof somebody who wakes up every day\n\n某人每天起床\n\nand works very, very hard to make their life better.\n\n工作努力，生活蒸蒸日上\n\nThese stories can really change the way that we think about each other.\n\n这些故事确实能够改变我们思考对方的方式\n\nAnd if we can catalyze\n\n如果我们能催化出\n\na supportive community to come around these individuals\n\n一个支持性的社区来帮助这些人\n\nand to participate in their story\n\n来参与他们的故事\n\nby lending a little bit of money,\n\n给他们提供一点钱\n\nI think that can change the way we believe in each other\n\n我想那就能改变我们互信的方式\n\nand each other's potential.\n\n以及相互的潜力\n\nNow for me, Kiva is just the beginning.\n\n现在对我来说，Kiva只是刚刚开始\n\nAnd as I look forward to what is next,\n\n当我寻找下一个目标时\n\nit's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.\n\n我至今学到的这些是非常有帮助的\n\nThe first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.\n\n第一就是，我所提到的，创业是新观点\n\nKiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,\n\nKiva的借款人，在我和他们交谈时，在我了解他们几年后\n\nhave taught me what entrepreneurship is.\n\n他们教会我什么是创业\n\nAnd I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.\n\n我认为，它的核心是一种让生活更美好的决心\n\nYou see an opportunity\n\n你看到了机会\n\nand you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.\n\n你决定去做些什么来把握机会\n\nIn short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today\n\n即，明天会更好\n\nand going after that.\n\n并持续这种信念\n\nSecond thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.\n\n第二件事就是，这些贷款是很有意思的交流工具\n\nSo they're not a donation.\n\n他们不是为了捐款\n\nYeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.\n\n是的，好像听起来差不多\n\nBut in fact, when you give something to someone\n\n但事实上，当你给予时\n\nand they say, \"Thanks,\" and let you know how things go,\n\n他们说谢谢并告诉你事情的发展\n\nthat's one thing.\n\n那仅是一方面\n\nWhen you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,\n\n当你借钱时，他们慢慢地还钱\n\nyou have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.\n\n你有了借口来持续对话\n\nThis continued attention -- this ongoing attention --\n\n这种持续性的关注，不断发展的关注\n\nis a really big deal\n\n才是至关重要的\n\nto build different kinds of relationships among us.\n\n这建立起我们之间的各种不同的关系\n\nAnd then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,\n\n第三，我从这些企业家那里学到了我该知道的东西\n\nwhen all else is equal,\n\n在同等情况下\n\ngiven the option to have just money to do what you need to do,\n\n一个选择是仅仅给他们钱，让他们做他们需要做的事情\n\nor money plus the support and encouragement\n\n另一个选择是钱以及来自全球的\n\nof a global community,\n\n支持和鼓励\n\npeople choose the community plus the money.\n\n人们选择的是第二个\n\nThat's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.\n\n这是一个更加有意义的组合，更有力量的组合\n\nSo with that in mind, this particular incident\n\n有了那样的想法，这特别的需求\n\nhas led to the things that I'm working on now.\n\n引导出了我现在所做的\n\nI see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.\n\n我看到了各个地方的企业家们，是我乐于看到的\n\nAnd one thing that I've seen\n\n我还看到了一件事\n\nis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.\n\n世界上已经有很多支持性社区存在了\n\nWith social networks,\n\n通过社交网络\n\nit's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us\n\n一种令人惊奇的方式，让和我们有共同目标的人的数量\n\nin our own supportive communities, rapidly.\n\n在我们的支持性社区里迅速增长\n\nAnd so, as I have been thinking about this,\n\n也因此，我曾想过这些\n\nI've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities\n\n我一直在想，如何我们能够激励这些支持性社区\n\nto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas\n\n去催化更多的创业点子\n\nand to catalyze all of us\n\n去催化更多像我们一样的人\n\nto make tomorrow better than today?\n\n让明天更美好呢\n\nAs I've researched what's going on in the United States,\n\n我研究了一些在美国发生的事情\n\na few interesting little insights have come up.\n\n几个很有意思的事情\n\nSo one is that, of course, as we all might expect,\n\n其中一个是，当然，众望所归\n\nmany small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world\n\n很多美国的和世界范围内的小企业\n\nstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do\n\n仍旧需要资金来成长和扩张\n\nor they might need money during a hard month.\n\n或者他们需要资金度过某个艰难时期\n\nBut there's always a need for resources close by.\n\n对资源的需求总是存在的\n\nAnother thing is, it turns out,\n\n但是\n\nthose resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --\n\n这些资源通常不是来源于你所期望的地方\n\nbanks, venture capitalists,\n\n比如银行，风投\n\nother organizations and support structures --\n\n或者一些组织和支持性结构\n\nthey come from friends and family.\n\n这些资源来自于朋友和家庭\n\nSome statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses\n\n一些数据显示85%或更多的小企业的资金\n\ncomes from friends and family.\n\n来源于朋友和家庭\n\nThat's around 130 billion dollars a year --\n\n每年大概有1300亿美元\n\nit's a lot.\n\n很多啊\n\nAnd third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,\n\n第三，对于这些从朋友和家庭来筹集资金的人们\n\nit's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,\n\n是很尴尬的，他们不知道怎么开口\n\nhow to ask, what to promise in return,\n\n也不知道怎么来担保回报\n\neven though they have the best of intentions\n\n即使他们有最佳的计划\n\nand want to thank those people that are supporting them.\n\n并想感谢这些帮助他们的人们\n\nSo to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way\n\n因此，以一种全新的方式来使用支持性社区的力量\n\nand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves\n\n并让企业家自己去决定\n\nexactly what that financial exchange should look like,\n\n是什么样的金融交易的方式\n\nexactly what fits them and the people around them,\n\n以及他们所适合的和他们周围的人\n\nthis week actually,\n\n事实上，这周\n\nwe're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,\n\n我们低调地启动了Profounder\n\nwhich is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need\n\n一个“众筹”平台让他们朋友和家人投资\n\nthrough investments from their friends and family.\n\n这些小企业\n\nAnd it's investments, not donations, not loans,\n\n这些投资不是捐款，也不是贷款\n\nbut
