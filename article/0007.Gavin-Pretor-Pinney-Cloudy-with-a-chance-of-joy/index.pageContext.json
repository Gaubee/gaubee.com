All right?\nAnd you look up and what do you see?\nRight? Or maybe the opposite.\nYou've just been dumped by your partner,\nand everywhere you look, it's kissing couples.\n(Laughter)\nPerhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.\nYou know, you're thinking about your own mortality.\nAnd there, on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.\n(Laughter)\nOr maybe you see a topless sunbather.\n(Laughter)\nWhat would that mean?\nWhat would that mean? I have no idea.\nBut one thing I do know is this:\nThe bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.\nI think we should stand up for them,\nwhich is why, a few years ago,\nI started the Cloud Appreciation Society.\nTens of thousands of members now\nin almost 100 countries around the world.\nAnd all these photographs that I'm showing,\nthey were sent in by members.\nAnd the society exists to remind people of this:\nClouds are not something to moan about.\nFar from it. They are, in fact,\nthe most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.\nI think, if you live with your head in the clouds\nevery now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.\nAnd I want to show you why, with the help of\nsome of my favorite types of clouds.\nLet's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud,\nnamed after the Latin for a lock of hair.\nIt's composed entirely of ice crystals\ncascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere,\nand as these ice crystals fall,\nthey pass through different layers with different winds\nand they speed up and slow down,\ngiving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances,\nthese brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.\nAnd these winds up there can be very, very fierce.\nThey can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.\nThese clouds are bombing along,\nbut from all the way down here,\nthey appear to be moving gracefully, slowly,\nlike most clouds.\nAnd so to tune into the clouds is to slow down,\nto calm down.\nIt's like a bit of everyday meditation.\nThose are common clouds.\nWhat about rarer ones, like the lenticularis,\nthe UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?\nThese clouds form in the region of mountains.\nWhen the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain,\nit can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak,\nwith these clouds hovering at the crest\nof these invisible standing waves of air,\nthese flying saucer-like forms,\nand some of the early black-and-white UFO photos\nare in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.\nA little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right?\nThis is when a layer is made up of very, very cold\nwater droplets, and in one region they start to freeze,\nand this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards\nwith the ice crystals cascading and falling down below,\ngiving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.\nRarer still, the Kelvin-Helmholtz cloud.\nNot a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.\nThis looks like a series of breaking waves,\nand it's caused by shearing winds -- the wind\nabove the cloud layer and below the cloud layer\ndiffer significantly, and in the middle, in between,\nyou get this undulating of the air,\nand if the difference in those speeds is just right,\nthe tops of the undulations curl over\nin these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.\nAll right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus,\nbut they're not that rare.\nIf you look up, and you pay attention to the sky,\nyou'll see them sooner or later,\nmaybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.\nAnd you'll see them around where you live.\nClouds are the most egalitarian\nof nature's displays, because we all have a good,\nfantastic view of the sky.\nAnd these clouds, these rarer clouds,\nremind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.\nNothing is more nourishing, more stimulating\nto an active, inquiring mind than being surprised,\nbeing amazed. It's why we're all here at TED, right?\nBut you don't need to rush off\naway from the familiar, across the world\nto be surprised.\nYou just need to step outside,\npay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday,\nso mundane that everybody else misses it.\nOne cloud that people rarely miss is this one:\nthe cumulonimbus storm cloud.\nIt's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail.\nThese clouds spread out at the top in this enormous\nanvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.\nThey are an expression of the majestic architecture\nof our atmosphere.\nBut from down below, they are the embodiment\nof the powerful, elemental force and power\nthat drives our atmosphere.\nTo be there is to be connected in the driving rain\nand the hail, to feel connected to our atmosphere.\nIt's to be reminded that we are creatures\nthat inhabit this ocean of air.\nWe don't live beneath the sky. We live within it.\nAnd that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere\nfeels to me like an antidote.\nIt's an antidote to the growing tendency we have\nto feel that we can really ever experience life\nby watching it on a computer screen, you know,\nwhen we're in a wi-fi zone.\nBut the one cloud that best expresses\nwhy cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever\nis this one, the cumulus cloud.\nRight? It forms on a sunny day.\nIf you close your eyes and think of a cloud,\nit's probably one of these that comes to mind.\nAll those cloud shapes at the beginning,\nthose were cumulus clouds.\nThe sharp, crisp outlines of this formation\nmake it the best one for finding shapes in.\nAnd it reminds us\nof the aimless nature of cloudspotting,\nwhat an aimless activity it is.\nYou're not going to change the world\nby lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?\nIt's pointless. It's a pointless activity,\nwhich is precisely why it's so important.\nThe digital world conspires to make us feel\neternally busy, perpetually busy.\nYou know, when you're not dealing with\nthe traditional pressures of earning a living\nand putting food on the table, raising a family,\nwriting thank you letters,\nyou have to now contend with\nanswering a mountain of unanswered emails,\nupdating a Facebook page,\nfeeding your Twitter feed.\nAnd cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing.\n(Laughter)\nAnd sometimes we need -\n(Applause)\nSometimes we need excuses to do nothing.\nWe need to be reminded by these\npatron goddesses of idle fellows\nthat slowing down\nand being in the present, not thinking about\nwhat you've got to do and what you should have done,\nbut just being here, letting your imagination\nlift from the everyday concerns down here\nand just being in the present, it's good for you,\nand it's good for the way you feel.\nIt's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity.\nIt's good for your soul.\nSo keep looking up,\nmarvel at the ephemeral beauty,\nand always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause)</p>","markdownContent":"\nClouds.\nHave you ever noticed how much people moan about them?\nThey get a bad rap.\nIf you think about it, the English language\nhas written into it negative associations towards the clouds.\nSomeone who's down or depressed,\nthey're under a cloud.\nAnd when there's bad news in store,\nthere's a cloud on the horizon.\nI saw an article the other day.\nIt was about problems with computer processing\nover the Internet.\n\"A cloud over the cloud,\" was the headline.\nIt seems like they're everyone's default\ndoom-and-gloom metaphor.\nBut I think they're beautiful, don't you?\nIt's just that their beauty is missed\nbecause they're so omnipresent,\nso, I don't know, commonplace,\nthat people don't notice them.\nThey don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds\nunless they get in the way of the sun.\nAnd so people think of clouds as\nthings that get in the way.\nThey think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions,\nand then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking.\n(Laughter)\nBut most people, when you stop to ask them,\nwill admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds.\nIt's like a nostalgic fondness,\nand they make them think of their youth.\nWho here can't remember thinking, well,\nlooking and finding shapes in the clouds\nwhen they were kids?\nYou know, when you were masters of daydreaming?\nAristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright,\nhe described the clouds as the patron godesses\nof idle fellows\ntwo and a half thousand years ago,\nand you can see what he means.\nIt's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant\nto allow ourselves the indulgence\nof just allowing our imaginations\nto drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity.\nI think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.\nI think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps,\nto look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out\nfrom behind the clouds and go, \"Wait a minute,\nthat's two cats dancing the salsa!\"\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nOr seeing the big, white, puffy one up there\nover the shopping center looks like\nthe Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank.\n(Laughter)\nThey're like nature's version of those inkblot images,\nyou know, that shrinks used to show their patients\nin the '60s,\nand I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds,\nyou'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.\nLet's say you're in love.
