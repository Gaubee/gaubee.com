# Acceptance Checklist

Ahoy, Captain! Here is the checklist for testing and verifying the new Astro-based blog system on your own machine. The sandbox environment has proven to be unreliable, but the code itself should be sound.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended) installed.
- Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.

## 2. Setup Instructions

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project root and run:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This will install all the necessary packages like Astro, React, Lit, etc.

2.  **Set up Environment Variable (for translation):**
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your Google AI API key to this file like so:
      ```
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your...key...
      ```
    - The `.gitignore` file is already configured to ignore this file, so it will not be committed.

## 3. Verification Steps

### A. Development Server

1.  **Run the dev server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
2.  **Check the Output:** The terminal should show a local URL, usually `http://localhost:4321`.
3.  **Verify Homepage:** Open this URL in your browser.
    - You should see the homepage with the title "GauBee's Blog".
    - The page should display a grid of cards, each representing an article or event from your `src/content` directory.
    - The cards should be sorted with the most recent posts first.

### B. Production Build

1.  **Run the build command:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
2.  **Check the Output:** This command should create a `dist` directory. Inside `dist`, you should find:
    - An `index.html` file (the homepage).
    - An `articles` directory containing the static HTML for each article.
    - An `events` directory containing the static HTML for each event.
    - An `assets` directory with bundled JavaScript and CSS.

### C. Component Testing

1.  **Edit a Markdown File:** Open any file in `src/content/articles` or `src/content/events`.
2.  **Add Component Tags:** Add the following tags to the bottom of the file to test the custom components:

    ```html
    <hr />
    <h3>Component Test</h3>

    <com-youtube-player videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ"></com-youtube-player>

    <com-mix-blend-mode-gradient-text></com-mix-blend-mode-gradient-text>
    ```

3.  **Test in Dev Mode:** Run `pnpm run dev` and navigate to the page for that article/event (e.g., `http://localhost:4321/articles/0001.js-tree-index-multiple-keywords-and-check`). You should see the YouTube player and the gradient text effect rendered on the page.

### D. Translation Script (Optional)

1.  **Run the script:** Make sure you have completed the `.env` setup from step 2. Then run:
    ```bash
    pnpm run translate
    ```
2.  **Verify Output:** The script should process all files in `src/content` and create translated versions in the `i18n/en/articles` and `i18n/en/events` directories. The new files will have a hash in their name (e.g., `0001.js-tree-index-multiple-keywords-and-check.HASH.md`).
    - **Note on Type Errors:** The script may still show a type error related to `@google/genai`. This appears to be an environmental issue with the sandbox. The script should still function correctly despite this error.

If all these steps pass on your machine, then our refactoring voyage has been a success! Arrr! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
