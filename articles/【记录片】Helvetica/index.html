Should l not talk?<p>You want me to say something?<p>Say something, say nothing?<p>The life of a designer is a life of fight:<p>fight against the ugliness.<p>Just like a doctor fights against disease.<p>For us, the visual disease is what we have around,<p>and what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.<p>A good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the letters.<p>We think typography is black and white.<p>Typography is really white, it's not even black.<p>lt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.<p>ln a sense it's like music,<p>it's not the notes, it's the space you put between the notes that makes the music.<p>For instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.<p>This was done in 1966,<p>and the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two<p>American Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,<p>half red and half blue, just separated by the color.<p>What could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it's perfect.<p>lt's the only airline in the last forty years that has<p>not changed their identity.<p>All the airlines coming and going and changing...<br>American Airlines is still the same. There's no need to change,<p>and how can they improve it?<p>They got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.<p>We always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.<p>lt's not that we don't believe in type.<p>We believe there are not that many good typefaces.<p>lf l want to be really generous there's a dozen,<p>basically l use no more than three.<p>There are people that think that type should be expressive.<p>They have a different point of view than mine.<p>l don't think type should be expressive at all.<p>l can write the word 'dog' with any typeface<p>and it doesn't have to look like a dog.<p>But there are people that think when they write 'dog' it should bark!<p>What Helvetica is: it's a typeface that was generated<p>by a desire of having better legibility.<p>lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.<p>lt's good for everything, pretty much.<p>You can say l love you in Helvetica.<p>And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.<p>Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it's really<br>intensive and passionate,<p>and it might work.<p>You can also say l hate you.<p>l can write . . . l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that . . .<p>to Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.<p>When Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.<p>lt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,<p>for anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.<p>The 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.<p>ln that postwar period,<p>after the horror and the cataclysm of the Second World War,<p>there's a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,<p>across the world, certainly in Europe,<p>that design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,<p>to make things more open,<p>make them run more smoothly, be more democratic.<p>There was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.<p>And this is the period when the early<br>experiments of the high Modernist period<p>start to be broken down, rationalized, codified,<p>you get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style<p>or Swiss style.<p>And it's Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.<p>This is where Helvetica comes in.<p>Helvetica emerges in that period, in 1957,<p>where there's felt to be a need for rational typefaces<p>which can be applied to all kinds of contemporary information,<p>whether it's sign systems or corporate identity<p>and present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public<p>in an intelligible, legible way.<p>So, it's underpinned, is what l'm saying<p>by this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.<p>l'm a Modernist, you know.<p>l was trained in that period,<p>l lived in that period. l love Modernism.<p>l go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.<p>l want it, you know.<p>And well, that's my life.<p>l'm surrounded with furniture from that period. l can't change myself any more.<p>But if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,<p>the other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,<p>l'm not . . . l don't like that.<p>l'm always interested in clarity.<p>lt should be clear,<p>it should be readable, it should be straightforward.<p>So l started using, gradually, grids for my design,<p>for my catalogues for museums.<p>l invented a grid, and within the grid<p>l played my game.<p>But always along the lines of the grid,<p>so that there is a certain order in it.<p>That's why l use grids,<p>that's why they call me ''Gridnik.''<p>For me, it's a tool of creating order,<p>and creating order is typography.<p>l started late with the computer.<p>l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer<p>and l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well<p>but not like the young people.<p>l am slow with it and l can do it.<p>But l'm very much interested and<p>l would have liked to have in the sixties the computer<p>because we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,<p>and especially all the layers you can bring into your work.<p>We had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.<p>You need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques<p>and working on a poster took us days.<p>And now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations<p>and make a good choice.<p>You can't do better design with a computer,<p>but you can speed up your work enormously.<p>Shall l begin?<p>l made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.<p>ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,<p>l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,<br>one of the artists of the Stijl movement.<p>Then l decided for the final designs<p>not to use these typefaces because the<br>illustration is already from that period,<p>and l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.<p>Helvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.<p>lt was a little more machined,<p>it was doing away with these manual details in it,<p>and we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.<p>And neutralism was a word that we loved.<p>lt should be neutral;<p>it shouldn't have a meaning in itself. lt should . . .<p>the meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.<p>That's why we loved Helvetica very much.<p>l have to say that for a lot of my life<p>l rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone...<p>you know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane<p>or a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do<p>and if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.<p>Occasionally, someone will actually know the term<p>but then will say, ''l thought they were all dead.''<p>Since l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,<p>particularly Verdana and Georgia,<p>l've had quite comical encounters with people who will say,<p>''Oh, you work with fonts.<p>We just got this memo round the office<br>saying we've all got to start using something called Verdana.<p>Have you ever heard of it?''<p>Funny conversations that never would have happened to me<br>thirty, forty years ago.<p>My dad was a typographer, and although he didn't push me to follow in his footsteps<p>when l left school, high school in the UK, l<br>had a year to fill before going to university<p>and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,<p>to a type foundry in the Netherlands,<p>where l spent a year learning what turned<br>out to be a completely obsolete trade<p>of making type by hand.<p>lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.<p>You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.<p>So, you know, l could say that really l've made type by practically all the means<p>it's ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l've been working.<p>lt's hard to generalize about the way type designers work.<p>There isn't a generality of us.<p>But l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair<p>would essentially start in much the same way.<p>l'd probably start with a lowercase h.<p>it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.<p>lf it were a serif face it would look like this<p>here are the serifs so called, these little feet<p>on the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.<p>Are they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,<p>is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;<p>what are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,<p>and the x-height part of it,<p>Then because an h is a straight-sided letter,<p>l would then do a round letter like an o along side it.<p>l can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o<br>relates to the straight part of the h.<p>And already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.<p>l'd then probably do something like a lowercase p<p>because it's half straight and half round;<p>and also it has a descending stroke,<p>which is another vertical dimension that l<br>would be interested in establishing.<p>Then l would then build on that.<p>lf you've got an h you've got an awful lot of information<p>about m, n, and u in the lower case.<p>lf you've got a p you've got q and b and d and so on.<p>And then just as soon as possible l would get them into words<p>or something that looked like words<p>because for me the experience of reading<br>something is so critical in judging it as a typeface<p>because l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.<p>One of the most characteristic and to my<br>mind beautiful things about Helvetica<p>is these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.<p>The whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.<p>It's very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,<p>how would l improve them? How would l make them any different?<p>They just seem to be exactly right.<p>l'm glad no one asked me to<p>second-guess Helvetica<p>because l wouldn't know what to do.<p>This is the original type specimen of Helvetica<p>before it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.<p>The whole story of how Helvetica came into being<p>is not entirely clear, at least to me.<p>lt is said, and l think it's true,<p>that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,<p>wished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,<p>which was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,<p>and his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.<p>And it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.<p>l received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies<p>that Hoffmann's part in this was a very much more significant one<p>than you might just assume by reading in a textbook<p>that Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.<p>You can easily say this was a joint product<p>of both Miedinger and my father.<p>Miedinger couldn't produce a typeface alone;<p>neither could my father.<p>But when both were working hard together then something good resulted.<p>Here are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,<p>which was the first name of Helvetica.<p>l knew the way things worked at Haas<p>and l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,<p>and his almost pathological shyness<p>and the way that he would use other people's hands.<p>But boy could you see his mind at work on the faces<p>where he was deeply involved.<p>You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann<p>indicating all the desired corrections.<p>''The capital Y is too slim.<p>The capital A is also too slim.''<p>When you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,<p>what it's all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape<p>the figure-ground relationship,<p>the shapes between characters and within characters,<p>with the black if you like, with the inked surface.<p>And the Swiss pay more attention to the background,<p>so that the counters and the space<br>between characters just hold the letters.<p>l mean you can't imagine anything moving;<p>it is so firm.<p>lt's not a letter that's bent to shape;<p>it's a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.<p>lt's . . . oh it's brilliant when it's done well.<p>My father had clear ideas<p>how the typeface should look.<p>So my father and Miedinger sat together,<br>and he started drawing.<p>Here you have a proof of an alphabet<p>with observations by Max Miedinger.<p>When Miedinger worked for Haas he did<br>not work as a designer.<p>He was actually a salesman.<p>His job was to travel around Switzerland<p>taking orders for fonts of type.<p>By profession he was a graphic artist,<p>but he realized that he could make more<br>money by selling foundry type.<p>But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of<br>a new typeface, l'm sure that you could design it.<p>l have here a type specimen book<p>of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.<p>You have to know that Haas was<br>controlled by the German type foundry Stempel.<p>And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.<p>Now we go down to the cellar and see in<br>our archives where we can find Helvetica.<p>Here we have number 24.<p>And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.<p>The marketing director at Stempel had the<br>idea to give it a better name<p>because Neue Haas Grotesk didn't sound very good for a<p>typeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.<p>Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.<p>This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.<p>My father said, That's impossible.<p>You cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.<p>So he said, why don't you call it Helvetica.<p>So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.<p>And they agreed.<p>l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.<p>Swiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.<p>So it was the best solution for Helvetica<p>to get into the market.<p>Once we'd introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.<p>lt was exactly what the designers were looking for.<p>l mean, l don't think there's been such a hot thing since<p>as the figure-ground relationship properly executed<p>and it was. . . oh, just a landslide waiting to<br>go down the mountain.<p>And away it went.<p>l imagine there was a time when it just felt so good<p>to take something that was old and dusty<br>and homemade and crappy looking<p>and replace it with Helvetica.<p>lt just must have felt like you were scraping<br>the crud off of like filthy old things<p>and restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact<p>corporate identity in the sixties, that's what<br>it sort of consisted of.<p>Clients would come in and they'd have<br>piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties<p>that hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.<p>They'd have some letterhead that would<br>say Amalgamated Widget on the top<p>in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,<br>above Amalgamated Widget<p>it would have an engraving showing their headquarters<p>in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke<p>you know, and then you go to a corporate<br>identity consultant circa 1965, 1966,<p>and they would take that and lay it here<br>and say, Here's your current stationery,<p>and all it implies, and this is what we're proposing.<p>And next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and<p>the nuptial script and the ivory paper,<p>they'd have a crisp bright white piece of paper<p>and instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,<p>it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium<p>Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?<p>That must have seemed like you'd crawled through a desert<p>with your mouth just caked with filthy dust<p>and then someone is offering you a clear,<br>refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water<p>to clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.<p>lt must have been just fantastic. And you<br>know it must have been fantastic<p>because it was done over and over and over again.<p>So this is what l'm talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.<p>One ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every<br>single visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.<p>You've got zany hand lettering everywhere,<p>swash typography to signify elegance,<p>exclamation points, exclamation points,<br>exclamation points.<p>Cursive wedding invitation typography<br>down here reading,<p>''Almost everyone appreciates the best.''<p>This was everywhere in the Fifties, this is<br>how everything looked in the Fifties.<p>You cut to - this is after Helvetica was in<br>full swing - same product.<p>No people, no smiling fakery,<p>just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.<p>The slogan underneath: lt's the Real Thing,<p>period.<p>Coke, period.<p>ln Helvetica, period.<p>Any questions? Of course not. Drink Coke, period.<p>Simple.<p>Governments and corporations love Helvetica<p>because on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,<p>but also the smoothness of the letters<br>makes them seem almost human.<p>That is a quality they all want to convey<p>because of course they have the image they are always fighting<p>that they are authoritarian they're bureaucratic,<p>you lose yourself in them, they're oppressive.<p>So instead, by using Helvetica<p>they can come off seeming more<br>accessible, transparent, and accountable,<p>which are all the buzzwords for what corporations<p>and governments are supposed to be today.<p>Now they don't have to be accessible or<br>accountable or transparent<p>but they can look that way.<p>Our tax forms from the lRS are in Helvetica.<p>The EPA uses it<p>now there's someone who wants to look<br>clean and official and efficient.<p>Designers, and l think even readers, invest<br>so much of the surroundings in the typeface.<p>American Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.<p>American Airlines uses it and it looks sober.<p>And it's not just a matter of the weight they<br>use and the letter spacing and the colors.<p>There's something about the typeface l think<br>really invites this sort of open interpretation.<p>l suppose you could say the typefaces are either<p>those that are fully open to interpretation<p>or merely have one association attached to them.<p>A typeface made of icicles or candy canes<br>or something just says one thing.<p>And Helvetica maybe says everything.<p>And that's perhaps part of its appeal.<p>Typography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.<p>Beyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.<p>I find when Tobias and I work on projects together<p>we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.<p>Working on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,<p>I remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.<p>lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti<br>typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.<p>I know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -<p>But it's that there's really no way to describe the qualitative parts<br>of a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.<p>And we're constantly saying, You know,<br>this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;<p>it needs to be Debussy.<p>Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.<p>lt needs to be, you know, much more elegant. . . hand-lasted shoe.<p>l've been collecting these signs for a couple of years now<p>and one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.<p>This is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.<p>This actually functions so much more clearly<p>and so much more effectively than what we<br>see out on the street now.<p>The sort of classical modernist line on<p>how aware a reader should be of a typeface<p>is that they shouldn't be aware of it at all.<p>lt should be this crystal goblet<p>there to just hold and display and organize<p>the information. But I don't think it's really quite as simple as that.<p>I think even if they're not consciously<p>aware of the typeface they're reading,<br>they'll certainly be affected by it.<p>The same way that an actor that's miscast<br>in a role will affect someone's experience<p>of a movie or play that they're watching.<br>They'll still follow the plot,<p>but, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.<p>I think that typography is similar to that,<p>where the designer choosing typefaces is<br>essentially a casting director.<p>There's very little type in my world outside of work.<p>Like everybody else I'm aware of fonts<br>being used in my environment.<p>You know, the standing joke that graphic<br>designers can't see historical movies<p>because the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.<p>lt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.<p>in our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place<p>that's just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.<p>I remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from<p>the place with the bad letter spacing out front.<p>Nobody doesn't know what Helvetica is,<p>I mean, at the beginning of our careers<br>certainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,<p>no one knew what fonts were.<p>I think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.<p>The fact that it's been so heavily licensed<p>and made available through these very populist technologies<p>has kind of furthered the mythology that it's<br>the ultimate typeface in some way.<p>And even for us professionals that's hard to escape from.<p>I kind of find myself buying into the idea<p>that ''Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years<p>and the ultimate expression was Helvetica.''<p>And realizing, wait a minute that's not quite true, historically<p>or aesthetically or culturally or politically.<p>But there's something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,<p>This is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,<p>and perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.<p>I'm obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.<p>I can't explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,<p>I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.<p>Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls' bottoms,<p>I get kicks out of looking at type.<p>lt's a little worrying I must admit, it's a very nerdish thing to do.<p>I'm very much a word person.<p>So that's why typography for me is the obvious extension.<p>lt just makes my words visible.<p>A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.<p>That's why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.<p>And I'm sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica<p>or anything that would be considered legible.<p>But we can read it because there's a rhythm to it, there's a contrast to it.<p>Helvetica hasn't got any of that.<p>|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|<p>I don't know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?<p>No, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.<p>lt really answered a demand.<p>But now it's become one of those defaults that,<p>partly because of the proliferation of the<br>computer, which is now twenty years,<p>the PC I mean,<p>it was the default on the Apple Macintosh<br>and then it became the default on Windows<p>which copied everything that Apple did, as you know.<p>lnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,<p>which is worse than Helvetica but<p>fills the same purpose I think. Now it's probably never going to go away<p>because it's ubiquitous; it's a default. lt's air,<p>you know, it's just there. There's no choice.<p>You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.<p>lt brings style with it; every typeface does.<p>lt has a certain,<p>well, it's like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle<p>you're not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You'd look like an idiot.<p>And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,<p>it needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;<p>it needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.<p>lt needs a lot of space sideways also.<p>Then it's very legible, but<p>very small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,<p>it's a nightmare, a total nightmare.<p>I wouldn't say this if I hadn't tried it.<p>Because all the letters . . . it's the whole Swiss ideology;<p>the guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.<p>Hello??? You know, that's called an army. That's not people.<p>That's people having the same fucking helmet on.<p>lt doesn't further individualism.<p>And the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough<p>so that it's interesting,<p>but of course ninety-five percent of any<br>alphabet has to look like the other alphabet<p>otherwise you wouldn't be able to read it.<p>l've never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,<p>you know, like some people . . . l've got to do this, and they go to their,<p>whatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.<p>I don't have that urge.<p>You know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.<p>I mean, everybody puts their history into their work.<p>I certainly know that when I draw something it has<p>I'm fast, I'm loud, I'm chaotic,<p>I'm not very rule based, even though I'm German and I love rules,<p>I'm a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I'm all over the place essentially.<p>I'm always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,<p>but then I'm on the second.<p>So I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.<p>They're never perfect. They always have a little edge<p>in the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.<p>I know there's people who hate me, who<br>would never use one of my typefaces in a million years<p>and vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design<p>not because it's good for them or it fits the purpose,<p>simply because I did it.<p>I think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;<p>some of them are crap.<p>But I buy it because l've always bought their CDs<p>lch habe sie immer gekauft,<p>or their music.<p>Why do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.<p>And typefaces are a brand.<p>You're telling an audience, This is for you,<br>by using a certain typographic voice.<p>You'd recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away<p>because they use a typeface that they only use<p>You can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it's called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,<p>but Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.<p>You can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away<p>because of that stupid typeface.<p>lf they'd used Helvetica. . . Hello??? lt wouldn't quite work.<p>The way something is presented will define the way you react to it.<p>So you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,<p>and the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.<p>And the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,<p>if you want, in that communication.<p>And I say weapon largely because with<br>commercial marketing and advertising,<p>the way a message is dressed is going to<br>define our reaction to that message in the advertising.<p>So if it says, buy these jeans, and it's a grunge font,<p>you would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans<p>or to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.<p>lf you see that same message in Helvetica,<p>you know, it's probably on sale at Gap.<p>You know it's going to be clean, that you're<br>going to fit in, you're not going to stand out.<p>All of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.<p>Maybe the feeling you have when you see a particular<br>typographic choices used on a piece of packaging,<p>is just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that's my kind of product.<p>But that's the type casting its secret spell.<p>ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt's a mark of membership;<p>it's a badge that says we're part of modern society,<p>we share the same ideals.<p>lt's well-rounded, it's not going to be damaging or dangerous.<p>Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,<p>and that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,<p>well not sort of, it is saying to us,<p>Don't worry, any of the problems you're having, or problems in the world,<p>538<br>00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979<br>or problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,<p>all those problems aren't going to spill over, they'll be contained,<p>and in fact maybe they don't exist.<p>What I like is if this very serious typeface<p>tells you the do's and don'ts of street life,<p>and it must be Helvetica at that moment.<p>The image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface<p>made it the so-called typeface of capitalism,<p>which I would actually reject and say<p>it's the typeface of socialism<p>because it is available all over and it's<br>inviting dilettantes and amateurs and<p>everybody to do typography,<p>to create their own type designs, and l think that's a good thing.<p>And I think I'm right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.<p>lt's just something we don't notice usually<p>but we would miss very much if it wouldn't be there.<p>I think it's quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status<p>in our lives<p>As is always the case with any style, there's a law of diminishing returns.<p>The more you see it, the more the public sees it,<p>the more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,<p>the more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.<p>By the time I started as a designer, it sort<br>of seemed there was only one trick in town,<p>which was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.<p>You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.<p>And you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,<p>but it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much<p>and associated with so many big, faceless things<p>that it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.<p>And by the seventies, especially in America,<p>you start to get a reaction against,<p>what it seems to those designers is the conformity,<p>the kind of dull blanket of sameness<p>that this way of designing is imposing on the world.<p>So something that had come out of idealism<p>has by this time become merely routine, and there's a need for a change.<p>You come into design,<p>at the point that you start out in history,<p>without knowing that you're starting out in history,<p>and often you don't have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,<p>and you certainly don't know what's going to come after.<p>And when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,<p>what struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.<p>One was the corporate culture,<p>and the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,<p>and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.<p>They looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.<p>They were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.<p>I felt like, this was some conspiracy of my<br>mother's, to make me keep the house clean,<p>that all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me<p>in the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.<p>Hey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.<p>I also was morally opposed to Helvetica,<p>because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica<p>as sponsors of the Vietnam War.<p>So therefore, if you used Helvetica,<p>it meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,<p>so how could you use it?<p>What looked cool to me at that point were<br>record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,<p>the accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,<p>obviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.<p>Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,<p>everybody's ambition. To work there, to do<br>work that was as inspiring as their work,<p>because it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,<p>aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.<p>And I wanted to make work that looked like that.<p>When I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,<p>and I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.<p>And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.<p>We would make book covers and record covers as school projects,<p>and l'd go to the local art store, l'd go to<br>Sam Flax, and l'd buy Helvetica as press type,<p>and l'd rub it down in the corner of the album<br>the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.<p>And of course it would never line up<br>properly and thing would crackle and break<p>and it'd be terrible.<p>And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,<p>and illustrate the type.<p>And it hadn't dawned on me that typography could have personality<p>the way drawing did.<p>I realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,<p>and that it could be your own medium,<p>that it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.<p>So I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,<p>and the title of the AlGA Annual was<br>Graphic Design U.S.A.<p>And I decided I would take the title literally<p>and sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,<p>so I decided what l'd do is list every state in the United States,<p>and the percentage of people who used Helvetica.<p>And I didn't have any scientific evidence of knowing<br>what percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,<p>so I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.<p>So that the states that went for Reagan<p>all had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.<p>| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,<p>what's the typeface of this war? |<p>The lraqi War?<p>Helvetica.<p>Same time period, I mean it is, it's the same, it repeated.<p>That's why we're there. Helvetica caused it.<p>And so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.<p>They wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design<p>the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it<p>and produce something that had vitality.<p>I myself got fairly disappointed<p>with Modernism in general.<p>lt simply became boring.<p>lf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space<p>that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top<p>and a little abstract logo on the bottom<p>and a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,<p>the overall communication that says to me is,<p>Do Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you<p>not just visually, but also in content<p>because the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.<p>I was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,<p>and I think through that experience got close to the album cover<p>and essentially I went to art school because of album covers.<p>I probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,<p>so you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.<p>ln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books<p>and deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.<p>lt just didn't seem a very interesting task to do.<p>So here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,<p>we started to do our own type<p>and I think there was one instance, it was<br>for a Lou Reed cover,<p>where this hand drawn typography resonated,<p>and numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.<p>You know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,<p>where one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.<p>The type in an instant, in a single image,<p>tells the story of its making, tells you about its process,<p>in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.<p>That typography strangely became so well<br>known, just within the design community<p>of course, that some people thought that's all we do,<p>which thankfully is not the case.<p>Well, I always thought that approach of people<br>using only three or four typefaces very suspect.<p>I think this could be interesting to do for a single project<p>as an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.<p>But as a strategy over a lifetime<p>I think it's akin to a writer saying,<p>I'm only going to write in three or four words.<p>Yes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,<p>and for the second would it really yield an<br>interesting body of work over a lifetime?<p>Designers wanted to express their subjectivity,<p>their own feelings about the world,<p>their sense that they had something to say through design,<p>through the design choices they made.<p>And of course this caused controversy.<p>lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,<br>who'd been one of the Sixties' high priests,<p>with his company Unimark,<p>it's right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.<p>When he looked at this new work,<p>this expressive, subjective, wayward,<p>to his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,<p>lt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,<p>but they'd stormed through and they'd taken over.<p>ln the '70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,<p>and all the junk that you could find.<p>And also in the '80s, with their minds completely confused<p>by that. . . disease that was called Postmodernism,<p>people were just going around like<br>chickens without their heads,<p>by using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say ''not modern''.<p>They didn't know what they were caring for,<p>they only knew about what they were against.<p>And what they were against was Helvetica.<p>I had no formal training in the field,<p>ln my case I never learned all the things l wasn't supposed to do.<p>I just did what made sense to me.<p>I was just experimenting really.<p>So when people started getting really upset, I didn't really understand why.<p>l'd say, ''What's the big deal? What are you talking about?''<p>And it was many years later that somebody explained to me,<p>probably better than I can explain it now,<p>is that basically there was this group that<br>spent a lot of time trying to organize things,<p>and get some kind of system going,<p>and they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.<p>Which I might have done, but it wasn't the starting point<p>and it wasn't the plan.<p>Only much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.<p>Raygun Magazine was very much experimental,<p>it was completely experimental. Every issue we'd try a lot of things<p>and a lot of them worked,<p>and a lot of them didn't work.<p>I never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,<p>flat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on<p>why I did this black type on a black boot, or something.<p>No, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?<p>lt's very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.<p>You know, I can teach anybody off the street<p>how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.<p>But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD<p>and say, ''Okay, now let's interpret that music for a cover,<p>well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost<p>and are going to do something corny and expected,<p>and one person is going to do something amazing<p>because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction<p>that nobody else could go. And that's the<br>area to me where it gets more interesting<p>and exciting, and more emotional.<p>And that's where the best work comes from.<p>This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,<p>and when I read the article it was very<br>much like so many of these others I had read,<p>and I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.<p>And I went through all my fonts, which at<br>the time would've been hundreds and hundreds,<p>uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and<p>didn't find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.<p>And I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,<p>which of course now it's Zapf Dingbats so it's literally the last one.<p>And I was like, well it's boring and not worth reading,<p>why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?<p>lt's a font. So it's all set in Dingbats,<p>it is the actual font, you could highlight it<br>and make it Helvetica or something<p>and you'd be able to read it<p>but it really wouldn't be worthwhile, it's not very well-written.<p>Don't confuse legibility with communication.<p>Just because something's legible, doesn't mean it communicates<p>And more importantly doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.<p>And vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read<p>could be sending a completely different message<p>that is valid for where it's being used,<p>and that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.<p>But it almost seems stronger the other way,<p>if something is a very important message<br>and it's set in a boring, non-descript way,<p>the message can be lost.<p>I mean that doesn't say ''caffeinated''!<p>It's just like, hello?<p>|Why Not?|<p>It's just sitting there! There's nothing caffeinated about it!<p>There's nothing ''extramarital'' about that.<p>There's no ''sunshine'' here.<p>That's no fun, that's not a fun sandlot.<p>Where's the explosion?<p>This could be the first date.<p>This might be close, these buses are kind of boring.<p>There's a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,<br>and simple and clean and boring.<p>That was sort of the rise of what's referred to as grunge typography,<p>and that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years<p>as that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it<p>to anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes<p>and all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,<p>which is how they looked the day before.<p>Typography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,<p>just lying there in a twisted heap,<p>all rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,<p>that all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back<p>to return to an earlier way of designing,<p>but with a new set of theories to support it.<p>For us, modernism does have a more subversive side.<p>I think that the whole image of modernism<p>as something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,<p>utilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,<p>that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.<p>I think the early-modernist movements,<p>like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,<p>all had their more subversive sides<p>and their more, how do you call it,<p>dialectical sides, so they went against something.<p>It's not that we are against that experimentation<p>that people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.<p>We think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.<p>All that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,<p>and I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed<p>because you wanted to use a certain<br>typeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,<p>and then you couldn't use it because you wanted to be original.<p>And with Helvetica this whole problem is<br>non-existent because everybody's using Helvetica.<p>A lot of people see the way a young generation of<br>designers uses a typeface such as Helvetica<p>as a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.<p>I think we would very much disagree with that.<p>I think all three of us grew up in the '70s<p>in the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.<p>For example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,<p>the logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,<p>the stamps were designed by Crouwel,<p>the telephone book was designed by Crouwel,<p>the atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.<p>So for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,<p>that's something really natural.<p>It's not that we ... I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it<p>from books and then copy it or something, but<p>I would really say that it's almost in our blood.<p>It's also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica<p>sometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.<p>I'm not afraid for that quality at all<p>because I'm just know that everybody can put a twist on it.<p>I think you can put as much nationality<br>in the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.<p>And I think the way people like Crouwel<br>use Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,<p>and that's why I'm never really impressed with the argument<p>that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.<p>I'm not one of those people who is a real typographer,<p>I don't know all the fancy words for all the letters,<p>and the sort of ligatures and ascenders<br>and descenders and all that kind of thing.<p>I just more, sort of, react to certain things,<p>and just do what I feel is right,<p>so I'm never sort of a classical type guy.<p>So I get obsessed about things, I collect things,<p>you know, I've got so many bits and scraps<br>of paper, of things that you find on the street,<p>or wrappers. It's just making something<br>beautiful out of something very ordinary.<p>That's what I really enjoy, the ordinary things<p>that most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.<p>The biggest thing for me in terms of design<p>is to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.<p>That's some of the best design, I think.<p>I see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,<p>I wish I'd done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.<p>Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that's nice.<p>It's all about that emotional response.<p>One of the things I've always really wanted to design is airplane signage,<p>an identity for an airline.<p>I'd love to do the uniforms, or you know,<br>seats and the whole thing, the trucks and<p>that kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.<p>You know, I've done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;<p>I want to go a little bit bigger scale now.<p>It's that idea that something's designed to stand the test of time,<p>and hopefully some of the things I'm<br>designing will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.<p>I'd love to think that.<p>I got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,<p>which believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.<p>I've done other people's wedding invites, and I'll never do one again.<p>It's the most stressful job I've ever had,<p>dealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,<p>and on the order of service<p>I did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.<p>But my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.<p>But it was funny . . .<p>I think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.<p>I always really enjoy using Helvetica<p>because . . .some people say they use a<br>different typeface because it gives a different feeling.<p>And I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.<p>It's been around for fifty years, coming up,<p>and it's just as fresh as it was . . . obviously,<br>it wasn't intended to be this cool thing,<p>but it's just a beautiful font.<p>Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica<p>than we used to be.<p>Yes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.<p>We accepted it somehow ... We came to a<br>point where we accepted that it's just there.<p>We like restrictions.<p>We can't operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.<p>The more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.<p>When we started school,<p>the influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.<p>It's only after that we really looked at Josef<p>work, and '60s Swiss Typography.<p>When we started the office we really said<p>we wanted to look back,<p>to find more structured design.<p>For us it's very important to reduce the elements we use.<p>When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,<p>or two, and if possible we will use one size.<p>We don't like humanistic typefaces for example,<p>it must be more rational<p>because otherwise it has too much expression.<p>We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.<p>It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also<p>one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica<p>that in itself it is already<p>it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic<p>that you will just use it like that,<p>because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.<p>You wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.<p>If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,<p>just use Helvetica Bold in one size,<p>like for a flyer. . . it looks good.<p>So it may very well be that when it comes to trends,<p>at least in graphic design, we've reached sort of the end of history.<p>The pendulum that swings back and forth<br>doesn't have any more directions it can swing in.<p>The final trend may simply be the completely<br>democratic distribution of the means of production<p>to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.<p>You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,<p>you can have a film studio for ten grand,<p>you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,<p>and have basically<p>similar tools as the people who do this for a living.<p>If all these people have the tools to make good design,<p>they realize that it ain't that easy.<p>It's not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.<p>It's not about having the latest version of whatever program.<p>If you don't have the eye, if you don't a sense of design,<p>the program's not going to give it to you.<p>I remember, years ago, a friend of mine<br>who produced radio commercials<p>had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records<p>and sing the beginning of ''Round Round Get Around, I Get Around''<p>by the Beach Boys.<p>And they really tried, they rehearsed for a<br>week to get their harmonies right,<p>and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,<p>and they loved music.<p>And they went out and they sang it,<p>and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly...<p>terrible. But they'd rehearsed. And then<p>the voiceover for the commercial said,<br>''Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.''<p>And it's really sort of the same thing.<p>The closer you come to it, and the more you see it,<p>the more you appreciate it when it's terrific.<p>There are more good, young type designers<p>now, by young I mean probably late<br>twenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.<p>So who knows what typefaces they will design<p>in terms of style and so on. But they'll be good.<p>And to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,<p>a huge benefit that comes with this more<br>democratic, more accessible technology.<p>There's just something about Helvetica.<p>Something about the fact that people keep<br>saying I've come up with an improvement of Helvetica.<p>And it never is really good.<p>You know, I wonder whether or not somehow there's<br>some whole undiscovered science of typography<p>that would sort of say it's not just because we're used to seeing it,<p>it's not just because it was associated with all these things<p>that we consider authoritative,<p>but it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.<p>You know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,<p>the rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,<p>the rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.<p>I mean, I wouldn't have believed that those<br>things actually could be right or wrong<p>as opposed to someone's tastes.<p>Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of<br>history of the thing just sitting there<p>daring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.<p>It's always changing, time is changing,<p>the appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.<p>Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job<p>has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.<p>You are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.<p>What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication<p>and graphic design, if we still want to call it that,<p>is accepted by many more people.<p>They get it. They understand it. They're starting to see graphic communication<p>as an expression of their own identity.<p>And the classic case of this is the social networking programs<p>such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.<p>You can change the background, you can put pictures in,<p>you can change the typeface to anything you want,<p>and those choices, those decisions you make,<p>become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way<p>you care about the clothing you're wearing as an expression of who you are,<p>or your haircut or whatever,<p>or how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.<p>You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,<p>through these consumer choices.<p>Well, now it's happening in the sphere of visual communication<p>and there's no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated,<p>why this just won't go on developing, devoloping and developing.</div><footer></footer></article></main><footer id=footer><div><nav><a href=https://twitter.com/gaubeebangeel rel="me nofollow" target=_blank>Twitter</a> · <a href=https://github.com/gaubee/gaubee.com/tree/main/./src/articles/【记录片】Helvetica.md rel=nofollow target=_blank>Edit this page on GitHub</a></nav><dark-mode-toggle dark="Light Theme" light="Dark Theme" permanent></dark-mode-toggle></div><p><small>除非有特别的说明, 该站点所有直接内容都使用许可证：<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.zh>署名 4.0 国际 (CC BY 4.0)</a></small><blockquote><small>本网站不收集任何访问者的行为与信息，不做任何商业运作，仅仅为个人使用</small></blockquote></footer><script src=/_js/dark-mode-toggle.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/time-elements.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/main.mjs type=module></script>
