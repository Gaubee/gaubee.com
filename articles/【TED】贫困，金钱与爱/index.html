about each other<p>我们互相讲述的故事<p>matter very much.<p>非常重要<p>The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.<p>我们谈论与自己生活相关故事是有意义的<p>And most of all,<p>而我认为最重要的是<p>I think the way that we participate in each other's stories<p>我们参与到他人故事的方式<p>is of deep importance.<p>才是至关重要的<p>I was six years old<p>我六岁时<p>when I first heard stories about the poor.<p>当我第一次听到关于穷人的故事的时候<p>Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,<p>我并没有直接从穷人口中听到这些故事<p>I heard them from my Sunday school teacher<p>我从教堂周日学校的老师那里听到这些故事<p>and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.<p>和耶稣，也就是这些老师那里<p>I remember learning that people who were poor<p>我记得我学到了穷人<p>needed something material --<p>需要物质帮助<p>food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.<p>如食物，衣服，住处，那些他们没有的<p>And I also was taught, coupled with that,<p>我还学到了<p>that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --<p>我们这些五六岁的孩子应该做的是<p>it was our job, apparently, to help.<p>很明显，去帮助<p>This is what Jesus asked of us.<p>这也是耶稣需要我们做的<p>And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."<p>他还说，你为他们做的就是为我做的<p>Now I was pretty psyched.<p>现在， 我被极大的鼓舞了<p>I was very eager to be useful in the world --<p>我非常热切地希望自己能向世界证明自己的意义<p>I think we all have that feeling.<p>相信我们都有这样的感觉<p>And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.<p>此外，有意思的是上帝也需要帮助<p>That was news to me,<p>那对我来说真是个新闻<p>and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.<p>而且，这是貌似一个很重要的事情值得我们参与<p>But I also learned very soon thereafter<p>但是自从耶稣说了那句话之后，我也很快地理解了耶稣所说<p>that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,<p>那我同时将其释义为<p>the poor would always be with us.<p>贫穷和我们同在<p>This frustrated and confused me;<p>这让我沮丧和迷惑<p>I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment<p>我感觉我被安排了一个<p>that I had to do, and I was excited to do,<p>不得不做的同时令人振奋的作业<p>but no matter what I would do, I would fail.<p>但是不论我做什么，我都会失败<p>So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,<p>因此我感到迷茫，有点郁闷以及恼怒<p>like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.<p>好像我似乎误解了这里的一些东西<p>And I felt overwhelmed.<p>同时我感到了压力<p>And for the first time,<p>这也是第一次<p>I began to fear this group of people<p>我开始害怕一类人群<p>and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.<p>并对这一人群有负面的情绪<p>I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals<p>我的脑袋里呈现出这些人组成的长队<p>that were never going away, that would always be with us.<p>这个长队将一直伴随我们，永不会离去<p>They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,<p>他们会总是不停地要求我的帮助，要求我给他们东西<p>which I was excited to do,<p>这些虽然都是我喜欢做的<p>but I didn't know how it was going to work.<p>但是我并不知道将来会发生什么<p>And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,<p>我不知道但我无物可给的时候将会发生什么<p>especially if the problem was never going away.<p>特别是这个问题永远不会离去<p>In the years following,<p>几年之后<p>the other stories I heard about the poor growing up<p>我听到一些其他的故事关于减贫<p>were no more positive.<p>并不是那么积极<p>For example, I saw pictures and images<p>例如，我曾经看到了令人悲伤和苦恼的<p>frequently of sadness and suffering.<p>一些照片和图像<p>I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.<p>我听到穷人生活的不尽如人意<p>I heard about disease, I heard about war --<p>关于疾病，关于战争<p>they always seemed to be kind of related.<p>似乎这些都是和贫穷相关联的<p>And in general,<p>总的来说<p>I got this sort of idea<p>我有个这样的想法<p>that the poor in the world lived lives<p>穷人生活的世界<p>that were wrought with suffering and sadness,<p>充满悲伤，充满苦闷<p>devastation, hopelessness.<p>充满破坏，充满绝望<p>And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,<p>在那之后，我想到我们大家的感觉<p>is this predictable response,<p>就是这个可预知的回应<p>where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.<p>当我每次听到穷人时，我开始感觉不舒服<p>I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,<p>由于我的相对富裕让我开始感觉到罪恶<p>because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.<p>很明显的是因为我没有尽我所能把事情做得更好<p>And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.<p>因此，我感到羞愧<p>And so naturally,<p>自然地<p>I started to distance myself.<p>我开始疏远我自己<p>I stopped listening to their stories<p>我不再像以前一样细心地倾听<p>quite as closely as I had before.<p>他们的故事<p>And I stopped expecting things to really change.<p>我不再期望事情能真正有所改变<p>Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.<p>我还是会给予。表面看来，我似乎还在继续参与<p>I gave of my time and my money,<p>给予我的时间和金钱<p>I gave when solutions were on sale.<p>我给予的都是廉价的方案<p>The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.<p>一杯咖啡就是救一个孩子的命，是这样的<p>I mean who can argue with that?<p>我的意思是谁能说那是错的呢？<p>I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid<p>当我无路可退时，当我难以推辞时，我才给予<p>and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough<p>总体来说，负面情绪驱使我给予<p>that I gave to relieve my own suffering,<p>我的给予是为了减轻我自己的烦恼<p>not someone else's.<p>而不是其他人的<p>The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,<p>确实，我离开了那里地方<p>not out of a genuine place of hope<p>但我并没有远离希望之地<p>and excitement to help and of generosity.<p>没有远离帮助他人和慷慨解囊的兴奋<p>It became a transaction for me,<p>它变成了我的一个转折点<p>became sort of a trade.<p>变成了一种交易<p>I was purchasing something --<p>我是在购买什么东西<p>I was buying my right to go on with my day<p>我是在购买我继续生存<p>and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.<p>且不被这些糟糕新闻烦恼的权利<p>And I think the way that we go through that sometimes<p>我认为我们采用的这种方法，有时候<p>can, first of all,<p>首先能够<p>disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.<p>让一部分人或者一些个体灵魂出窍<p>And it can also turn into a commodity,<p>这种想法也能够变成一种商品<p>which is a very scary thing.<p>一种令人恐怖的东西<p>So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,<p>就是正如我所说所想<p>we kind of buy our distance,<p>我们好像在购买我们之间的距离<p>we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.<p>我们好像在购买我们继续生活的权利<p>I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.<p>我想这种交易事实上阻碍了我们得到我们最想得到的东西<p>It can get in the way of our desire<p>阻碍了我们的愿望<p>to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life<p>就是给予对他人真正有意义和有用的东西<p>and, in short to love.<p>即，去爱<p>Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me<p>欣慰地是，几年之后，我被改变了<p>because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.<p>因为我听了穆罕默德·尤努斯博士的演讲<p>I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,<p>在座大部分人也许知道他是谁<p>but to give the shorthand version<p>但我还是想给没有听说过他的人<p>for any who have not heard him speak,<p>做个简短的叙述<p>Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago<p>尤努斯博士在几年前获得了诺贝尔和平奖<p>for his work pioneering modern microfinance.<p>因为他在现代微金融领域所做的先驱工作<p>When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.<p>在他获得诺贝尔和平奖三年之前，我就听了他的演讲<p>But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --<p>如果你对微金融是陌生的，基本上，它可以<p>think of that as financial services for the poor.<p>理解为给穷人提供的金融服务<p>Think of all the things you get at your bank<p>就是，所有你在银行里<p>and imagine those products and services<p>可以获得的以及可以想到的<p>tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.<p>针对每天只有几美元生活费的人所提供的产品和服务<p>Dr. Yunus shared his story,<p>尤努斯博士分享了他的故事<p>explaining what that was,<p>阐述了事情的原貌<p>and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.<p>以及他和他的格莱珉银行所做到的<p>He also talked about, in particular, microlending,<p>他也讲到了，特别是，微信贷<p>which is a tiny loan<p>即，能够帮助人们创业和企业发展的<p>that could help someone start or grow a business.<p>微型贷款<p>Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.<p>他的演讲有如下几点原因让我感到兴奋<p>First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world<p>第一，我学到了一种新的方法来改变世界<p>that, for once, showed me, maybe,<p>其曾经向我展示了<p>a way to interact with someone<p>一种和他人互动的方式<p>and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird<p>并且给出一种让人不感到怪异的分享资源的方式<p>and didn't make me feel bad --<p>同时，这种方式不让我感到难堪<p>that was exciting.<p>很不错<p>But more importantly, he told stories about the poor<p>但更重要的是，他讲述关于穷人的故事<p>that were different than any stories I had heard before.<p>和我以前听到的故事有很多不同<p>In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.<p>事实上，以前听到的穷人在各方面都是弱势的<p>He was talking about strong, smart,<p>但他所讲的穷人是<p>hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day<p>坚强，聪明，刻苦的企业家们<p>and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.<p>这些企业家起早贪黑，努力地工作为了让他们和他们家人有更好的生活<p>All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better<p>他们只需少量的资金就能更快地，更好地拥有<p>was a little bit of capital.<p>他们理想的生活<p>It was an amazing sort of insight for me.<p>这对我来说是一个令人惊叹的见解<p>And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --<p>事实上，我被这个见解真真的打动了<p>it's hard to express now how much that affected me --<p>很难表达这个观点对我有多大的影响<p>but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,<p>不论如何，我确实被打动了。我也的确在几周后放弃了我的工作<p>and I moved to East Africa<p>继而搬迁到了东非<p>to try to see for myself what this was about.<p>就是想亲自看看情况<p>For the first time, actually, in a long time<p>这么长时间里，这是确实是第一次，<p>I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,<p>我想见到这些人，我想去见这些企业家<p>and see for myself what their lives were actually about.<p>并亲自看看他们真实的生活<p>So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania<p>因此，我在肯尼亚，乌干达，坦桑尼亚呆了3个月<p>interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars<p>和那些企业家们进行了交流<p>to start or grow a business.<p>就是用100美元贷款创业或者拓展业务的企业家们<p>And in fact, through those interactions,<p>事实上，通过这些交流<p>for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends<p>我第一次开始和这些各色各样的<p>with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there<p>原先本来远离我的<p>that was supposed to be far away.<p>人们成了朋友<p>I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.<p>我开始不断地交朋友<p>And over and over again,<p>并了解到他们的个人生活<p>as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,<p>我和他们交谈并且他们在一起待几天<p>I did hear stories of life change<p>我的确听到了他们生活改变的故事<p>and amazing little details of change.<p>以及那些令人惊叹的生活细节改变<p>So I would hear from goat herders<p>因此，我希望能够听到<p>who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.<p>那些牧羊人能够用他们得到的贷款去买更多的山羊<p>Their business trajectory would change.<p>他们的商业轨迹改变了<p>They would make a little bit more money;<p>他们能够赚更多的钱<p>their standard of living<p>他们的生活质量<p>would shift and would get better.<p>改变了，并变的更好了<p>And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,<p>他们能够对他们的生活做些细小的但卓有意义的调整<p>like they would start to send their children to school.<p>比如，他们可以开始把他们的孩子送去学校<p>They might be able to buy mosquito nets.<p>他们可以买蚊帐<p>Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.<p>也许他们可以买得起一个门锁让他们感到更安全<p>Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea<p>也许，仅仅是他们可以在他们的茶里放糖<p>and offer that to me when I came as their guest<p>当我做客时来款待我<p>and that made them feel proud.<p>这让他们感到自豪<p>But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,<p>即使我和20个不同的牧羊人聊天，也会有很多美丽的细节。<p>and some days that's what happened --<p>相信总有一天<p>these beautiful details of life change<p>这些美丽的令生活改变的细节<p>that were meaningful to them.<p>对他们来说是意义非凡的<p>That was another thing that really touched me.<p>这是另一个令我触动的事情<p>It was really humbling to see for the first time,<p>这是我第一次谦虚的感受到<p>to really understand<p>以至于确实懂得<p>that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,<p>即使我会用魔法棒并能够修好所有东西<p>I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.<p>但是我也很有可能把事情搞砸<p>Because the best way for people to change their lives<p>因为让人们改变生活的最好的方式<p>is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.<p>就是让他们自己去控制并按照他们自己认为最佳的方式进行<p>So I saw that and it was very humbling.<p>我看到了这一点，我感到那是很震撼人心的<p>Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.<p>此外，还有一件事情很有意思<p>I never once was asked for a donation,<p>我从未被要求捐助<p>which had kind of been my mode, right.<p>这似乎是我的作风，是吧？<p>There's poverty, you give money to help --<p>这里有贫困，你该给予金钱的帮助<p>no one asked me for a donation.<p>没有人请求我来捐款<p>In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.<p>事实上，没有人想让我怜悯他们<p>If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already<p>他们只是想把自己的事业做得更好<p>and to build on their own capabilities.<p>同时加强他们自己的能力<p>So what I did hear, once in a while,<p>因此，我一直听到的是<p>was that people wanted a loan --<p>人们需要贷款<p>I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.<p>我认为这听起来很合理并真的很令人激动<p>And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,<p>顺便说一下，我在大学里学的是哲学和诗歌<p>so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.<p>因此我在东非时并不懂利润和销售的区别<p>I just got this impression that the money would work.<p>我留下的印象是，钱就可以帮助他们<p>And my introduction to business<p>我的业务开端<p>was in these $100 little infuses of capital.<p>就是这些100美元的资金注入<p>And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,<p>我学到了利润，销售，杠杆和相关的知识<p>from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.<p>从农民，缝纫女工，牧羊人那里<p>So this idea<p>将这个想法<p>that these new stories of business and hope<p>这些商业和希望的新奇故事<p>might be shared with my friends and family,<p>和我的朋友和家人分享<p>and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed<p>以此，我们就能够得到他们需要的钱<p>to be able to continue their businesses as loans,<p>这些钱作为贷款让他们继续他们的事业<p>that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.<p>就是这样的一个点子变成了Kiva<p>A few months later, I went back to Uganda<p>几个月之后，我回到了乌干达<p>with a digital camera and a basic website<p>带着数码相机和一个很简单的网站<p>that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,<p>我和我的合作伙伴，Matthew一起做的<p>and took pictures of seven of my new friends,<p>然后给我的七个新朋友照了些照片<p>posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,<p>并在网上贴出了他们的创业故事<p>spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.<p>随后疯狂地给朋友和家人发，并声称“我们没犯法”<p>Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,<p>虽然还没有从证监会那里得到反馈<p>but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,<p>但是你觉得怎么样，想参与下么？<p>provide the money that they need?"<p>给需要钱的人提供资金?<p>The money came in basically overnight.<p>这些钱当天晚上就发过来了<p>We sent it over to Uganda.<p>我们就发给乌干达<p>And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;<p>六个月之后，美妙是事情发生了<p>the entrepreneurs received the money,<p>这些企业家支付了他们的借款<p>they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,<p>同时他们的事业也蒸蒸日上<p>and they were able to support themselves<p>他们能够丰衣足食了<p>and change the trajectory of their lives.<p>他们的生活轨迹改变了<p>In October of '05,<p>2005年十月份<p>after those first seven loans were paid,<p>在这七笔贷款都返还后<p>Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.<p>Matt和我取消了网页上的beta标志(测试期)<p>We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.<p>我们认为：这个小测验取得了成功<p>Let's start for real." That was our official launch.<p>我们开始正式运营这个网站<p>And then that first year, October '05 through '06,<p>在这之后的第一年，即2005年十月至2006年十月<p>Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.<p>Kiva协助了50万美元的贷款<p>The second year, it was a total of 15 million.<p>第二年，总额变成了1500万美元<p>The third year, the total was up to around 40.<p>第三年，到了4000万<p>The fourth year, we were just short of 100.<p>第四年，差不多1个亿了<p>And today, less than five years in,<p>至今，不到五年时间里<p>Kiva's facilitated<p>Kiva协助了<p>more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,<p>超过1.5亿美元的贷款，这可都是一个个25美元积累出来的哦<p>from lenders and entrepreneurs --<p>这些钱来自放贷人和企业家们<p>more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.<p>他们来自世界200个国家<p>So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.<p>这就是你今天看到的Kiva<p>And while those numbers and those statistics<p>这些数字和统计结果<p>are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,<p>对我来说很有趣也很有意思<p>to me, Kiva's really about stories.<p>对我来说，Kiva充满了故事<p>It's about retelling<p>它重述着<p>the story of the poor,<p>穷人的故事<p>and it's about giving ourselves<p>以及给他们<p>an opportunity to engage<p>一个机会来积极参与并承担责任<p>that validates their dignity,<p>这证明了他们的尊严<p>validates a partnership relationship,<p>证明了一种合作的关系<p>not a relationship that's based<p>而不是以前那种基于<p>on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary<p>捐款人和受款人<p>weirdness that can happen.<p>那种古怪的关系<p>But instead a relationship that can promote respect<p>现在的这种合作关系促进了尊敬<p>and hope<p>和希望<p>and this optimism<p>还有就是这种乐观向上的精神<p>that together we can move forward.<p>让我们携手共进<p>So what I hope is that,<p>我希望<p>not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --<p>这些钱不仅能够通过Kiva流动<p>that's a very positive and meaningful thing --<p>那是非常积极的和有意义的事情<p>but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,<p>而且我希望Kiva能够模糊<p>between the traditional rich and poor categories<p>传统的富裕和贫穷之间的界限<p>that we're taught to see in the world,<p>也就是我们小时候所认为的世界<p>this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.<p>这个错误的二分法将世界分隔成我们和他们， 有产和无产<p>I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.<p>我希望Kiva能够模糊这种界限<p>Because as that happens,<p>因为，当其发生时<p>I think we can feel free to interact<p>我想我们能够自由地交流<p>in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,<p>以更开放，更公正，更有创造力的方式<p>to engage with each other and to help each other.<p>来相互激励，相互帮助<p>Imagine how you feel<p>想象一下你的感觉<p>when you see somebody on street who is begging<p>当你看到一个人在街上乞讨时<p>and you're about to approach them.<p>而你又向他走去<p>Imagine how you feel;<p>想象一下你自己的感觉<p>and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody<p>这个人的不同的情形<p>who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work<p>这个人的创业故事和他所做的努力<p>who wants to tell you about their business.<p>这个人期望谈论他们的事业<p>Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.<p>他们微笑着谈论他们的成就<p>Imagine if you're speaking with somebody<p>试想，如果你正在<p>who's growing things and making them flourish,<p>事业蓬勃向上的人交谈<p>somebody who's using their talents<p>某人用他的智慧<p>to do something productive,<p>卓有成效地工作<p>somebody who's built their own business from scratch,<p>某人从零开始创业<p>someone who is surrounded by abundance,<p>他能够丰衣足食<p>not scarcity,<p>并远离贫穷<p>who's in fact creating abundance,<p>他确实在创造富足<p>somebody with full hands with something to offer,<p>他手上有东西可以奉献<p>not empty hands<p>而不是两手空空地<p>asking for you to give them something.<p>向你索要东西<p>Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect<p>试想，如果你能够听到你期望听到的故事<p>of somebody who wakes up every day<p>某人每天起床<p>and works very, very hard to make their life better.<p>工作努力，生活蒸蒸日上<p>These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.<p>这些故事确实能够改变我们思考对方的方式<p>And if we can catalyze<p>如果我们能催化出<p>a supportive community to come around these individuals<p>一个支持性的社区来帮助这些人<p>and to participate in their story<p>来参与他们的故事<p>by lending a little bit of money,<p>给他们提供一点钱<p>I think that can change the way we believe in each other<p>我想那就能改变我们互信的方式<p>and each other's potential.<p>以及相互的潜力<p>Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.<p>现在对我来说，Kiva只是刚刚开始<p>And as I look forward to what is next,<p>当我寻找下一个目标时<p>it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.<p>我至今学到的这些是非常有帮助的<p>The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.<p>第一就是，我所提到的，创业是新观点<p>Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,<p>Kiva的借款人，在我和他们交谈时，在我了解他们几年后<p>have taught me what entrepreneurship is.<p>他们教会我什么是创业<p>And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.<p>我认为，它的核心是一种让生活更美好的决心<p>You see an opportunity<p>你看到了机会<p>and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.<p>你决定去做些什么来把握机会<p>In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today<p>即，明天会更好<p>and going after that.<p>并持续这种信念<p>Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.<p>第二件事就是，这些贷款是很有意思的交流工具<p>So they're not a donation.<p>他们不是为了捐款<p>Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.<p>是的，好像听起来差不多<p>But in fact, when you give something to someone<p>但事实上，当你给予时<p>and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,<p>他们说谢谢并告诉你事情的发展<p>that's one thing.<p>那仅是一方面<p>When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,<p>当你借钱时，他们慢慢地还钱<p>you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.<p>你有了借口来持续对话<p>This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --<p>这种持续性的关注，不断发展的关注<p>is a really big deal<p>才是至关重要的<p>to build different kinds of relationships among us.<p>这建立起我们之间的各种不同的关系<p>And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,<p>第三，我从这些企业家那里学到了我该知道的东西<p>when all else is equal,<p>在同等情况下<p>given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,<p>一个选择是仅仅给他们钱，让他们做他们需要做的事情<p>or money plus the support and encouragement<p>另一个选择是钱以及来自全球的<p>of a global community,<p>支持和鼓励<p>people choose the community plus the money.<p>人们选择的是第二个<p>That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.<p>这是一个更加有意义的组合，更有力量的组合<p>So with that in mind, this particular incident<p>有了那样的想法，这特别的需求<p>has led to the things that I'm working on now.<p>引导出了我现在所做的<p>I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.<p>我看到了各个地方的企业家们，是我乐于看到的<p>And one thing that I've seen<p>我还看到了一件事<p>is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.<p>世界上已经有很多支持性社区存在了<p>With social networks,<p>通过社交网络<p>it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us<p>一种令人惊奇的方式，让和我们有共同目标的人的数量<p>in our own supportive communities, rapidly.<p>在我们的支持性社区里迅速增长<p>And so, as I have been thinking about this,<p>也因此，我曾想过这些<p>I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities<p>我一直在想，如何我们能够激励这些支持性社区<p>to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas<p>去催化更多的创业点子<p>and to catalyze all of us<p>去催化更多像我们一样的人<p>to make tomorrow better than today?<p>让明天更美好呢<p>As I've researched what's going on in the United States,<p>我研究了一些在美国发生的事情<p>a few interesting little insights have come up.<p>几个很有意思的事情<p>So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,<p>其中一个是，当然，众望所归<p>many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world<p>很多美国的和世界范围内的小企业<p>still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do<p>仍旧需要资金来成长和扩张<p>or they might need money during a hard month.<p>或者他们需要资金度过某个艰难时期<p>But there's always a need for resources close by.<p>对资源的需求总是存在的<p>Another thing is, it turns out,<p>但是<p>those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --<p>这些资源通常不是来源于你所期望的地方<p>banks, venture capitalists,<p>比如银行，风投<p>other organizations and support structures --<p>或者一些组织和支持性结构<p>they come from friends and family.<p>这些资源来自于朋友和家庭<p>Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses<p>一些数据显示85%或更多的小企业的资金<p>comes from friends and family.<p>来源于朋友和家庭<p>That's around 130 billion dollars a year --<p>每年大概有1300亿美元<p>it's a lot.<p>很多啊<p>And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,<p>第三，对于这些从朋友和家庭来筹集资金的人们<p>it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,<p>是很尴尬的，他们不知道怎么开口<p>how to ask, what to promise in return,<p>也不知道怎么来担保回报<p>even though they have the best of intentions<p>即使他们有最佳的计划<p>and want to thank those people that are supporting them.<p>并想感谢这些帮助他们的人们<p>So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way<p>因此，以一种全新的方式来使用支持性社区的力量<p>and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves<p>并让企业家自己去决定<p>exactly what that financial exchange should look like,<p>是什么样的金融交易的方式<p>exactly what fits them and the people around them,<p>以及他们所适合的和他们周围的人<p>this week actually,<p>事实上，这周<p>we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,<p>我们低调地启动了Profounder<p>which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need<p>一个“众筹”平台让他们朋友和家人投资<p>through investments from their friends and family.<p>这些小企业<p>And it's investments, not donations, not loans,<p>这些投资不是捐款，也不是贷款<p>but investments that have a dynamic return.<p>而是具有动态回报的投资<p>So the mapping of participating in the story,<p>这个“故事”的映射<p>it actually flows with the up and down.<p>事实上，时上时下<p>So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool<p>基本上，这是一个自己动手的工具<p>for small businesses to raise these funds.<p>用于小企业融资<p>And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,<p>你所要做的就是浏览这个网站，然后建立主页<p>create investment terms in a really easy way.<p>以简单明了的方式建立投资条款<p>We make it really, really simple for me<p>我们要让它简明扼要<p>as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.<p>也让其他用这个网站的人觉得简明扼要<p>And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.<p>我们允许创业者分享一定百分比的销售额<p>They can raise up to a million dollars<p>他们可以融资上百万美元<p>from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --<p>从无限的，未认证的，投资理念简单的投资者那里<p>everyday people, heaven forbid --<p>--都是些普通的投资者嘛，上帝会允许滴--<p>and they can share those returns over time --<p>他们能够分享回报<p>again, whatever terms they set.<p>不论什么他们设置的什么条款<p>As investors choose to become involved<p>当投资者参与其中时<p>based on those terms,<p>基于这些条款<p>they can either take their rewards back as cash,<p>他们能够得到现金回报<p>or they can decide in advance<p>或者他们可以提前决定<p>to give those returns away to a non-profit.<p>将这些回报送给非盈利组织<p>So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.<p>因此，他们可以做现金投资者或者非现金回报投资者<p>It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea<p>我的希望是这类的工具能给任何有帮助别人想法人们<p>a path to go do what they want to do in the world<p>一条途径去做他们想做的<p>and to gather the people around them that they already have,<p>凝聚他们周围的人<p>the people that know them best<p>这些最了解的他们人<p>and that love them and want to support them,<p>爱他们的以及想帮助他们的人<p>to gather them to make this happen.<p>大家一起将梦想变成现实<p>So that's what I'm working on now.<p>那就是我现在做的<p>And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.<p>更进一步，我就想说，看看这些工具<p>Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,<p>现在，Profounder才刚刚开始<p>and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.<p>它是可以触及的，是清楚的。它就是一根血管，一个工具<p>What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,<p>我们需要人们的关注并去使用它<p>just like they've cared enough to use Kiva<p>就想他们关注并使用Kiva一样<p>to make those connections.<p>来连接彼此<p>But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --<p>好消息是我不认为我站在这里是想说服你们，去关注<p>I'm not even going to try.<p>我根本不想尝试<p>I don't think, even though we often hear,<p>我不认为，即使我们经常听到<p>you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,<p>那些道德和品质的原因<p>the religious reasons,<p>还有宗教的原因<p>"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."<p>比如，这就是为什么关心和给予让你感到幸福之类的<p>I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;<p>我不需要去解释，你们懂的。<p>in fact, I think we know so much,<p>事实上，我想我们非常了解<p>and it's such a reality<p>现实<p>that we care so deeply,<p>我们很关心的现实<p>that in fact, what usually stops us<p>实际上，通常让我们停下来的<p>is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,<p>是我们害怕尝试害怕失败<p>because we care so very much about helping each other<p>因为我们太关心彼此<p>and being meaningful in each other's lives.<p>想在彼此的生活中做些有意义的事情<p>So what I think I can do today,<p>我想我今天能做的<p>that best thing I can give you --<p>就是给你讲述<p>I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.<p>我的故事，我已尽我所能了<p>And I think I can remind us that we do care.<p>我想提醒大家我们真的很在乎<p>I think we all already know that.<p>我们都很清楚<p>And I think we know that love is resilient enough<p>我想我们明白爱是足够坚韧的<p>for us to get out there and try.<p>让我们尽可能的去尝试<p>Just a sec.<p>稍等（感动啊~~）<p>(Applause)<p>（掌声）<p>Thanks.<p>谢谢<p>(Applause)<p>（掌声）<p>Thanks.<p>谢谢<p>(Applause)<p>（掌声）<p>For me, the best way to be inspired to try<p>对我来说，最好的激励自己去尝试的方法就是<p>is to stop and to listen<p>停下来并倾听<p>to someone else's story.<p>别人的故事<p>And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.<p>在此，我很感谢TED让我站在这里<p>And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,<p>我同时感激无论何时<p>guaranteed, I am inspired --<p>我保证，我都是倍受激励的<p>I am inspired by the person I am listening to.<p>我被那些有故事的人激励着<p>And I believe more and more every time I listen<p>每次我倾听他们的故事，我都会越来越相信<p>in that that person's potential to do great things in the world<p>对这个世界所做的伟大的贡献的人<p>and in my own potential to maybe help.<p>和我自己所提供的帮助<p>And that --<p>因此<p>forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --<p>忘了那些工具吧，忘了移动那些资源<p>that stuff's easy.<p>它们都不算什么<p>Believing in each other,<p>相信彼此<p>really being sure when push comes to shove<p>才是真正的价值<p>that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,<p>我们每一个人都能为这个世界出一把力<p>that is what can make our stories into love stories<p>那才是将故事变成爱的原因<p>and our collective story<p>以及把最后的故事<p>into one that continually perpetuates hope<p>变成一个持续永恒的希望<p>and good things for all of us.<p>和对我们都有益的事业<p>So that, this belief in each other,<p>因此，相信彼此<p>knowing that without a doubt<p>执此信念，坚定不移<p>and practicing that every day in whatever you do,<p>不论你做什么，都积极地实践这种信念<p>that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.<p>我相信这种信念终将改变世界并让明天更美好<p>Thank you.<p>谢谢大家<p>(Applause)<p>（掌声）<p><strong>2013/5/1 9:56:03</strong></div><footer></footer></article></main><footer id=footer><div><nav><a href=https://twitter.com/gaubeebangeel rel="me nofollow" target=_blank>Twitter</a> · <a href=https://github.com/gaubee/gaubee.com/tree/main/./src/articles/【TED】贫困，金钱与爱.md rel=nofollow target=_blank>Edit this page on GitHub</a></nav><dark-mode-toggle dark="Light Theme" light="Dark Theme" permanent></dark-mode-toggle></div><p><small>除非有特别的说明, 该站点所有直接内容都使用许可证：<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.zh>署名 4.0 国际 (CC BY 4.0)</a></small><blockquote><small>本网站不收集任何访问者的行为与信息，不做任何商业运作，仅仅为个人使用</small> <small style=display:block><a href=https://beian.miit.gov.cn/#/Integrated/recordQuery>闽ICP备17026139号-1</a></small></blockquote></footer><script src=/js/dark-mode-toggle.mjs type=module></script><script src=/js/time-elements.mjs type=module></script><script src=/js/main.mjs type=module></script>
