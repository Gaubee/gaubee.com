Should l not talk?\n\nYou want me to say something?\n\nSay something, say nothing?\n\nThe life of a designer is a life of fight:\n\nfight against the ugliness.\n\nJust like a doctor fights against disease.\n\nFor us, the visual disease is what we have around,\n\nand what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.\n\nA good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the letters.\n\nWe think typography is black and white.\n\nTypography is really white, it&#39;s not even black.\n\nlt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.\n\nln a sense it&#39;s like music,\n\nit&#39;s not the notes, it&#39;s the space you put between the notes that makes the music.\n\nFor instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.\n\nThis was done in 1966,\n\nand the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two\n\nAmerican Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,\n\nhalf red and half blue, just separated by the color.\n\nWhat could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it&#39;s perfect.\n\nlt&#39;s the only airline in the last forty years that has\n\nnot changed their identity.\n\nAll the airlines coming and going and changing...\nAmerican Airlines is still the same. There&#39;s no need to change,\n\nand how can they improve it?\n\nThey got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.\n\nWe always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.\n\nlt&#39;s not that we don&#39;t believe in type.\n\nWe believe there are not that many good typefaces.\n\nlf l want to be really generous there&#39;s a dozen,\n\nbasically l use no more than three.\n\nThere are people that think that type should be expressive.\n\nThey have a different point of view than mine.\n\nl don&#39;t think type should be expressive at all.\n\nl can write the word &#39;dog&#39; with any typeface\n\nand it doesn&#39;t have to look like a dog.\n\nBut there are people that think when they write &#39;dog&#39; it should bark!\n\nWhat Helvetica is: it&#39;s a typeface that was generated\n\nby a desire of having better legibility.\n\nlt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.\n\nlt&#39;s good for everything, pretty much.\n\nYou can say l love you in Helvetica.\n\nAnd you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.\n\nOr you can say it in Extra Bold if it&#39;s really\nintensive and passionate,\n\nand it might work.\n\nYou can also say l hate you.\n\nl can write . . . l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that . . .\n\nto Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.\n\nWhen Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.\n\nlt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,\n\nfor anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.\n\nThe 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.\n\nln that postwar period,\n\nafter the horror and the cataclysm of the Second World War,\n\nthere&#39;s a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,\n\nacross the world, certainly in Europe,\n\nthat design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,\n\nto make things more open,\n\nmake them run more smoothly, be more democratic.\n\nThere was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.\n\nAnd this is the period when the early\nexperiments of the high Modernist period\n\nstart to be broken down, rationalized, codified,\n\nyou get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style\n\nor Swiss style.\n\nAnd it&#39;s Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.\n\nThis is where Helvetica comes in.\n\nHelvetica emerges in that period, in 1957,\n\nwhere there&#39;s felt to be a need for rational typefaces\n\nwhich can be applied to all kinds of contemporary information,\n\nwhether it&#39;s sign systems or corporate identity\n\nand present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public\n\nin an intelligible, legible way.\n\nSo, it&#39;s underpinned, is what l&#39;m saying\n\nby this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.\n\nl&#39;m a Modernist, you know.\n\nl was trained in that period,\n\nl lived in that period. l love Modernism.\n\nl go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.\n\nl want it, you know.\n\nAnd well, that&#39;s my life.\n\nl&#39;m surrounded with furniture from that period. l can&#39;t change myself any more.\n\nBut if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,\n\nthe other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,\n\nl&#39;m not . . . l don&#39;t like that.\n\nl&#39;m always interested in clarity.\n\nlt should be clear,\n\nit should be readable, it should be straightforward.\n\nSo l started using, gradually, grids for my design,\n\nfor my catalogues for museums.\n\nl invented a grid, and within the grid\n\nl played my game.\n\nBut always along the lines of the grid,\n\nso that there is a certain order in it.\n\nThat&#39;s why l use grids,\n\nthat&#39;s why they call me &#39;&#39;Gridnik.&#39;&#39;\n\nFor me, it&#39;s a tool of creating order,\n\nand creating order is typography.\n\nl started late with the computer.\n\nl think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer\n\nand l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well\n\nbut not like the young people.\n\nl am slow with it and l can do it.\n\nBut l&#39;m very much interested and\n\nl would have liked to have in the sixties the computer\n\nbecause we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,\n\nand especially all the layers you can bring into your work.\n\nWe had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.\n\nYou need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques\n\nand working on a poster took us days.\n\nAnd now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations\n\nand make a good choice.\n\nYou can&#39;t do better design with a computer,\n\nbut you can speed up your work enormously.\n\nShall l begin?\n\nl made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.\n\nln the beginning, if you see the sketches,\n\nl tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,\none of the artists of the Stijl movement.\n\nThen l decided for the final designs\n\nnot to use these typefaces because the\nillustration is already from that period,\n\nand l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.\n\nHelvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.\n\nlt was a little more machined,\n\nit was doing away with these manual details in it,\n\nand we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.\n\nAnd neutralism was a word that we loved.\n\nlt should be neutral;\n\nit shouldn&#39;t have a meaning in itself. lt should . . .\n\nthe meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.\n\nThat&#39;s why we loved Helvetica very much.\n\nl have to say that for a lot of my life\n\nl rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone...\n\nyou know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane\n\nor a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do\n\nand if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.\n\nOccasionally, someone will actually know the term\n\nbut then will say, &#39;&#39;l thought they were all dead.&#39;&#39;\n\nSince l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,\n\nparticularly Verdana and Georgia,\n\nl&#39;ve had quite comical encounters with people who will say,\n\n&#39;&#39;Oh, you work with fonts.\n\nWe just got this memo round the office\nsaying we&#39;ve all got to start using something called Verdana.\n\nHave you ever heard of it?&#39;&#39;\n\nFunny conversations that never would have happened to me\nthirty, forty years ago.\n\nMy dad was a typographer, and although he didn&#39;t push me to follow in his footsteps\n\nwhen l left school, high school in the UK, l\nhad a year to fill before going to university\n\nand l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,\n\nto a type foundry in the Netherlands,\n\nwhere l spent a year learning what turned\nout to be a completely obsolete trade\n\nof making type by hand.\n\nlt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.\n\nYou know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.\n\nSo, you know, l could say that really l&#39;ve made type by practically all the means\n\nit&#39;s ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l&#39;ve been working.\n\nlt&#39;s hard to generalize about the way type designers work.\n\nThere isn&#39;t a generality of us.\n\nBut l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair\n\nwould essentially start in much the same way.\n\nl&#39;d probably start with a lowercase h.\n\nit tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.\n\nlf it were a serif face it would look like this\n\nhere are the serifs so called, these little feet\n\non the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.\n\nAre they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,\n\nis there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;\n\nwhat are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,\n\nand the x-height part of it,\n\nThen because an h is a straight-sided letter,\n\nl would then do a round letter like an o along side it.\n\nl can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o\nrelates to the straight part of the h.\n\nAnd already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.\n\nl&#39;d then probably do something like a lowercase p\n\nbecause it&#39;s half straight and half round;\n\nand also it has a descending stroke,\n\nwhich is another vertical dimension that l\nwould be interested in establishing.\n\nThen l would then build on that.\n\nlf you&#39;ve got an h you&#39;ve got an awful lot of information\n\nabout m, n, and u in the lower case.\n\nlf you&#39;ve got a p you&#39;ve got q and b and d and so on.\n\nAnd then just as soon as possible l would get them into words\n\nor something that looked like words\n\nbecause for me the experience of reading\nsomething is so critical in judging it as a typeface\n\nbecause l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.\n\nOne of the most characteristic and to my\nmind beautiful things about Helvetica\n\nis these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.\n\nThe whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.\n\nIt&#39;s very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,\n\nhow would l improve them? How would l make them any different?\n\nThey just seem to be exactly right.\n\nl&#39;m glad no one asked me to\n\nsecond-guess Helvetica\n\nbecause l wouldn&#39;t know what to do.\n\nThis is the original type specimen of Helvetica\n\nbefore it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.\n\nThe whole story of how Helvetica came into being\n\nis not entirely clear, at least to me.\n\nlt is said, and l think it&#39;s true,\n\nthat Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,\n\nwished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,\n\nwhich was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,\n\nand his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.\n\nAnd it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.\n\nl received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies\n\nthat Hoffmann&#39;s part in this was a very much more significant one\n\nthan you might just assume by reading in a textbook\n\nthat Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.\n\nYou can easily say this was a joint product\n\nof both Miedinger and my father.\n\nMiedinger couldn&#39;t produce a typeface alone;\n\nneither could my father.\n\nBut when both were working hard together then something good resulted.\n\nHere are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,\n\nwhich was the first name of Helvetica.\n\nl knew the way things worked at Haas\n\nand l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,\n\nand his almost pathological shyness\n\nand the way that he would use other people&#39;s hands.\n\nBut boy could you see his mind at work on the faces\n\nwhere he was deeply involved.\n\nYou have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann\n\nindicating all the desired corrections.\n\n&#39;&#39;The capital Y is too slim.\n\nThe capital A is also too slim.&#39;&#39;\n\nWhen you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,\n\nwhat it&#39;s all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape\n\nthe figure-ground relationship,\n\nthe shapes between characters and within characters,\n\nwith the black if you like, with the inked surface.\n\nAnd the Swiss pay more attention to the background,\n\nso that the counters and the space\nbetween characters just hold the letters.\n\nl mean you can&#39;t imagine anything moving;\n\nit is so firm.\n\nlt&#39;s not a letter that&#39;s bent to shape;\n\nit&#39;s a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.\n\nlt&#39;s . . . oh it&#39;s brilliant when it&#39;s done well.\n\nMy father had clear ideas\n\nhow the typeface should look.\n\nSo my father and Miedinger sat together,\nand he started drawing.\n\nHere you have a proof of an alphabet\n\nwith observations by Max Miedinger.\n\nWhen Miedinger worked for Haas he did\nnot work as a designer.\n\nHe was actually a salesman.\n\nHis job was to travel around Switzerland\n\ntaking orders for fonts of type.\n\nBy profession he was a graphic artist,\n\nbut he realized that he could make more\nmoney by selling foundry type.\n\nBut my father said, lf ever l have an idea of\na new typeface, l&#39;m sure that you could design it.\n\nl have here a type specimen book\n\nof both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.\n\nYou have to know that Haas was\ncontrolled by the German type foundry Stempel.\n\nAnd in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.\n\nNow we go down to the cellar and see in\nour archives where we can find Helvetica.\n\nHere we have number 24.\n\nAnd there it is, the Helvetica drawings.\n\nThe marketing director at Stempel had the\nidea to give it a better name\n\nbecause Neue Haas Grotesk didn&#39;t sound very good for a\n\ntypeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.\n\nStempel suggested the name of Helvetia.\n\nThis is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.\n\nMy father said, That&#39;s impossible.\n\nYou cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.\n\nSo he said, why don&#39;t you call it Helvetica.\n\nSo in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.\n\nAnd they agreed.\n\nl think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.\n\nSwiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.\n\nSo it was the best solution for Helvetica\n\nto get into the market.\n\nOnce we&#39;d introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.\n\nlt was exactly what the designers were looking for.\n\nl mean, l don&#39;t think there&#39;s been such a hot thing since\n\nas the figure-ground relationship properly executed\n\nand it was. . . oh, just a landslide waiting to\ngo down the mountain.\n\nAnd away it went.\n\nl imagine there was a time when it just felt so good\n\nto take something that was old and dusty\nand homemade and crappy looking\n\nand replace it with Helvetica.\n\nlt just must have felt like you were scraping\nthe crud off of like filthy old things\n\nand restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact\n\ncorporate identity in the sixties, that&#39;s what\nit sort of consisted of.\n\nClients would come in and they&#39;d have\npiles of goofy old brochures from the fifties\n\nthat hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.\n\nThey&#39;d have some letterhead that would\nsay Amalgamated Widget on the top\n\nin some goofy, maybe a script typeface,\nabove Amalgamated Widget\n\nit would have an engraving showing their headquarters\n\nin Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke\n\nyou know, and then you go to a corporate\nidentity consultant circa 1965, 1966,\n\nand they would take that and lay it here\nand say, Here&#39;s your current stationery,\n\nand all it implies, and this is what we&#39;re proposing.\n\nAnd next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and\n\nthe nuptial script and the ivory paper,\n\nthey&#39;d have a crisp bright white piece of paper\n\nand instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,\n\nit just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium\n\nCan you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?\n\nThat must have seemed like you&#39;d crawled through a desert\n\nwith your mouth just caked with filthy dust\n\nand then someone is offering you a clear,\nrefreshing, distilled, icy glass of water\n\nto clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.\n\nlt must have been just fantastic. And you\nknow it must have been fantastic\n\nbecause it was done over and over and over again.\n\nSo this is what l&#39;m talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.\n\nOne ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every\nsingle visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.\n\nYou&#39;ve got zany hand lettering everywhere,\n\nswash typography to signify elegance,\n\nexclamation points, exclamation points,\nexclamation points.\n\nCursive wedding invitation typography\ndown here reading,\n\n&#39;&#39;Almost everyone appreciates the best.&#39;&#39;\n\nThis was everywhere in the Fifties, this is\nhow everything looked in the Fifties.\n\nYou cut to - this is after Helvetica was in\nfull swing - same product.\n\nNo people, no smiling fakery,\n\njust a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.\n\nThe slogan underneath: lt&#39;s the Real Thing,\n\nperiod.\n\nCoke, period.\n\nln Helvetica, period.\n\nAny questions? Of course not. Drink Coke, period.\n\nSimple.\n\nGovernments and corporations love Helvetica\n\nbecause on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,\n\nbut also the smoothness of the letters\nmakes them seem almost human.\n\nThat is a quality they all want to convey\n\nbecause of course they have the image they are always fighting\n\nthat they are authoritarian they&#39;re bureaucratic,\n\nyou lose yourself in them, they&#39;re oppressive.\n\nSo instead, by using Helvetica\n\nthey can come off seeming more\naccessible, transparent, and accountable,\n\nwhich are all the buzzwords for what corporations\n\nand governments are supposed to be today.\n\nNow they don&#39;t have to be accessible or\naccountable or transparent\n\nbut they can look that way.\n\nOur tax forms from the lRS are in Helvetica.\n\nThe EPA uses it\n\nnow there&#39;s someone who wants to look\nclean and official and efficient.\n\nDesigners, and l think even readers, invest\nso much of the surroundings in the typeface.\n\nAmerican Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.\n\nAmerican Airlines uses it and it looks sober.\n\nAnd it&#39;s not just a matter of the weight they\nuse and the letter spacing and the colors.\n\nThere&#39;s something about the typeface l think\nreally invites this sort of open interpretation.\n\nl suppose you could say the typefaces are either\n\nthose that are fully open to interpretation\n\nor merely have one association attached to them.\n\nA typeface made of icicles or candy canes\nor something just says one thing.\n\nAnd Helvetica maybe says everything.\n\nAnd that&#39;s perhaps part of its appeal.\n\nTypography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.\n\nBeyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.\n\nI find when Tobias and I work on projects together\n\nwe tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.\n\nWorking on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,\n\nI remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.\n\nlt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti\ntypewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.\n\nI know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -\n\nBut it&#39;s that there&#39;s really no way to describe the qualitative parts\nof a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.\n\nAnd we&#39;re constantly saying, You know,\nthis has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;\n\nit needs to be Debussy.\n\nOr this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.\n\nlt needs to be, you know, much more elegant. . . hand-lasted shoe.\n\nl&#39;ve been collecting these signs for a couple of years now\n\nand one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.\n\nThis is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.\n\nThis actually functions so much more clearly\n\nand so much more effectively than what we\nsee out on the street now.\n\nThe sort of classical modernist line on\n\nhow aware a reader should be of a typeface\n\nis that they shouldn&#39;t be aware of it at all.\n\nlt should be this crystal goblet\n\nthere to just hold and display and organize\n\nthe information. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really quite as simple as that.\n\nI think even if they&#39;re not consciously\n\naware of the typeface they&#39;re reading,\nthey&#39;ll certainly be affected by it.\n\nThe same way that an actor that&#39;s miscast\nin a role will affect someone&#39;s experience\n\nof a movie or play that they&#39;re watching.\nThey&#39;ll still follow the plot,\n\nbut, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.\n\nI think that typography is similar to that,\n\nwhere the designer choosing typefaces is\nessentially a casting director.\n\nThere&#39;s very little type in my world outside of work.\n\nLike everybody else I&#39;m aware of fonts\nbeing used in my environment.\n\nYou know, the standing joke that graphic\ndesigners can&#39;t see historical movies\n\nbecause the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.\n\nlt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.\n\nin our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place\n\nthat&#39;s just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.\n\nI remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from\n\nthe place with the bad letter spacing out front.\n\nNobody doesn&#39;t know what Helvetica is,\n\nI mean, at the beginning of our careers\ncertainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,\n\nno one knew what fonts were.\n\nI think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.\n\nThe fact that it&#39;s been so heavily licensed\n\nand made available through these very populist technologies\n\nhas kind of furthered the mythology that it&#39;s\nthe ultimate typeface in some way.\n\nAnd even for us professionals that&#39;s hard to escape from.\n\nI kind of find myself buying into the idea\n\nthat &#39;&#39;Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years\n\nand the ultimate expression was Helvetica.&#39;&#39;\n\nAnd realizing, wait a minute that&#39;s not quite true, historically\n\nor aesthetically or culturally or politically.\n\nBut there&#39;s something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,\n\nThis is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,\n\nand perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.\n\nI&#39;m obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.\n\nI can&#39;t explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,\n\nI just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.\n\nOther people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls&#39; bottoms,\n\nI get kicks out of looking at type.\n\nlt&#39;s a little worrying I must admit, it&#39;s a very nerdish thing to do.\n\nI&#39;m very much a word person.\n\nSo that&#39;s why typography for me is the obvious extension.\n\nlt just makes my words visible.\n\nA real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.\n\nThat&#39;s why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.\n\nAnd I&#39;m sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica\n\nor anything that would be considered legible.\n\nBut we can read it because there&#39;s a rhythm to it, there&#39;s a contrast to it.\n\nHelvetica hasn&#39;t got any of that.\n\n|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|\n\nI don&#39;t know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?\n\nNo, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.\n\nlt really answered a demand.\n\nBut now it&#39;s become one of those defaults that,\n\npartly because of the proliferation of the\ncomputer, which is now twenty years,\n\nthe PC I mean,\n\nit was the default on the Apple Macintosh\nand then it became the default on Windows\n\nwhich copied everything that Apple did, as you know.\n\nlnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,\n\nwhich is worse than Helvetica but\n\nfills the same purpose I think. Now it&#39;s probably never going to go away\n\nbecause it&#39;s ubiquitous; it&#39;s a default. lt&#39;s air,\n\nyou know, it&#39;s just there. There&#39;s no choice.\n\nYou have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.\n\nlt brings style with it; every typeface does.\n\nlt has a certain,\n\nwell, it&#39;s like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle\n\nyou&#39;re not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You&#39;d look like an idiot.\n\nAnd Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,\n\nit needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;\n\nit needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.\n\nlt needs a lot of space sideways also.\n\nThen it&#39;s very legible, but\n\nvery small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,\n\nit&#39;s a nightmare, a total nightmare.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say this if I hadn&#39;t tried it.\n\nBecause all the letters . . . it&#39;s the whole Swiss ideology;\n\nthe guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.\n\nHello??? You know, that&#39;s called an army. That&#39;s not people.\n\nThat&#39;s people having the same fucking helmet on.\n\nlt doesn&#39;t further individualism.\n\nAnd the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough\n\nso that it&#39;s interesting,\n\nbut of course ninety-five percent of any\nalphabet has to look like the other alphabet\n\notherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to read it.\n\nl&#39;ve never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,\n\nyou know, like some people . . . l&#39;ve got to do this, and they go to their,\n\nwhatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.\n\nI don&#39;t have that urge.\n\nYou know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.\n\nI mean, everybody puts their history into their work.\n\nI certainly know that when I draw something it has\n\nI&#39;m fast, I&#39;m loud, I&#39;m chaotic,\n\nI&#39;m not very rule based, even though I&#39;m German and I love rules,\n\nI&#39;m a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I&#39;m all over the place essentially.\n\nI&#39;m always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,\n\nbut then I&#39;m on the second.\n\nSo I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.\n\nThey&#39;re never perfect. They always have a little edge\n\nin the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.\n\nI know there&#39;s people who hate me, who\nwould never use one of my typefaces in a million years\n\nand vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design\n\nnot because it&#39;s good for them or it fits the purpose,\n\nsimply because I did it.\n\nI think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;\n\nsome of them are crap.\n\nBut I buy it because l&#39;ve always bought their CDs\n\nlch habe sie immer gekauft,\n\nor their music.\n\nWhy do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.\n\nAnd typefaces are a brand.\n\nYou&#39;re telling an audience, This is for you,\nby using a certain typographic voice.\n\nYou&#39;d recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away\n\nbecause they use a typeface that they only use\n\nYou can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it&#39;s called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,\n\nbut Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.\n\nYou can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away\n\nbecause of that stupid typeface.\n\nlf they&#39;d used Helvetica. . . Hello??? lt wouldn&#39;t quite work.\n\nThe way something is presented will define the way you react to it.\n\nSo you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,\n\nand the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.\n\nAnd the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,\n\nif you want, in that communication.\n\nAnd I say weapon largely because with\ncommercial marketing and advertising,\n\nthe way a message is dressed is going to\ndefine our reaction to that message in the advertising.\n\nSo if it says, buy these jeans, and it&#39;s a grunge font,\n\nyou would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans\n\nor to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.\n\nlf you see that same message in Helvetica,\n\nyou know, it&#39;s probably on sale at Gap.\n\nYou know it&#39;s going to be clean, that you&#39;re\ngoing to fit in, you&#39;re not going to stand out.\n\nAll of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.\n\nMaybe the feeling you have when you see a particular\ntypographic choices used on a piece of packaging,\n\nis just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that&#39;s my kind of product.\n\nBut that&#39;s the type casting its secret spell.\n\nln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt&#39;s a mark of membership;\n\nit&#39;s a badge that says we&#39;re part of modern society,\n\nwe share the same ideals.\n\nlt&#39;s well-rounded, it&#39;s not going to be damaging or dangerous.\n\nHelvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,\n\nand that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,\n\nwell not sort of, it is saying to us,\n\nDon&#39;t worry, any of the problems you&#39;re having, or problems in the world,\n\n538\n00:42:26,010 --&gt; 00:42:28,979\nor problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,\n\nall those problems aren&#39;t going to spill over, they&#39;ll be contained,\n\nand in fact maybe they don&#39;t exist.\n\nWhat I like is if this very serious typeface\n\ntells you the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of street life,\n\nand it must be Helvetica at that moment.\n\nThe image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface\n\nmade it the so-called typeface of capitalism,\n\nwhich I would actually reject and say\n\nit&#39;s the typeface of socialism\n\nbecause it is available all over and it&#39;s\ninviting dilettantes and amateurs and\n\neverybody to do typography,\n\nto create their own type designs, and l think that&#39;s a good thing.\n\nAnd I think I&#39;m right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.\n\nlt&#39;s just something we don&#39;t notice usually\n\nbut we would miss very much if it wouldn&#39;t be there.\n\nI think it&#39;s quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status\n\nin our lives\n\nAs is always the case with any style, there&#39;s a law of diminishing returns.\n\nThe more you see it, the more the public sees it,\n\nthe more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,\n\nthe more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.\n\nBy the time I started as a designer, it sort\nof seemed there was only one trick in town,\n\nwhich was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.\n\nYou know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.\n\nAnd you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,\n\nbut it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much\n\nand associated with so many big, faceless things\n\nthat it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.\n\nAnd by the seventies, especially in America,\n\nyou start to get a reaction against,\n\nwhat it seems to those designers is the conformity,\n\nthe kind of dull blanket of sameness\n\nthat this way of designing is imposing on the world.\n\nSo something that had come out of idealism\n\nhas by this time become merely routine, and there&#39;s a need for a change.\n\nYou come into design,\n\nat the point that you start out in history,\n\nwithout knowing that you&#39;re starting out in history,\n\nand often you don&#39;t have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,\n\nand you certainly don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to come after.\n\nAnd when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,\n\nwhat struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.\n\nOne was the corporate culture,\n\nand the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,\n\nand at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.\n\nThey looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.\n\nThey were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.\n\nI felt like, this was some conspiracy of my\nmother&#39;s, to make me keep the house clean,\n\nthat all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me\n\nin the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.\n\nHey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.\n\nI also was morally opposed to Helvetica,\n\nbecause I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica\n\nas sponsors of the Vietnam War.\n\nSo therefore, if you used Helvetica,\n\nit meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,\n\nso how could you use it?\n\nWhat looked cool to me at that point were\nrecord album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,\n\nthe accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,\n\nobviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.\n\nPushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,\n\neverybody&#39;s ambition. To work there, to do\nwork that was as inspiring as their work,\n\nbecause it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,\n\naside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.\n\nAnd I wanted to make work that looked like that.\n\nWhen I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,\n\nand I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.\n\nAnd I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.\n\nWe would make book covers and record covers as school projects,\n\nand l&#39;d go to the local art store, l&#39;d go to\nSam Flax, and l&#39;d buy Helvetica as press type,\n\nand l&#39;d rub it down in the corner of the album\nthe way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.\n\nAnd of course it would never line up\nproperly and thing would crackle and break\n\nand it&#39;d be terrible.\n\nAnd Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,\n\nand illustrate the type.\n\nAnd it hadn&#39;t dawned on me that typography could have personality\n\nthe way drawing did.\n\nI realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,\n\nand that it could be your own medium,\n\nthat it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.\n\nSo I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,\n\nand the title of the AlGA Annual was\nGraphic Design U.S.A.\n\nAnd I decided I would take the title literally\n\nand sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,\n\nso I decided what l&#39;d do is list every state in the United States,\n\nand the percentage of people who used Helvetica.\n\nAnd I didn&#39;t have any scientific evidence of knowing\nwhat percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,\n\nso I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.\n\nSo that the states that went for Reagan\n\nall had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.\n\n| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,\n\nwhat&#39;s the typeface of this war? |\n\nThe lraqi War?\n\nHelvetica.\n\nSame time period, I mean it is, it&#39;s the same, it repeated.\n\nThat&#39;s why we&#39;re there. Helvetica caused it.\n\nAnd so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.\n\nThey wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design\n\nthe horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it\n\nand produce something that had vitality.\n\nI myself got fairly disappointed\n\nwith Modernism in general.\n\nlt simply became boring.\n\nlf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space\n\nthat has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top\n\nand a little abstract logo on the bottom\n\nand a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,\n\nthe overall communication that says to me is,\n\nDo Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you\n\nnot just visually, but also in content\n\nbecause the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.\n\nI was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,\n\nand I think through that experience got close to the album cover\n\nand essentially I went to art school because of album covers.\n\nI probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,\n\nso you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.\n\nln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books\n\nand deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.\n\nlt just didn&#39;t seem a very interesting task to do.\n\nSo here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,\n\nwe started to do our own type\n\nand I think there was one instance, it was\nfor a Lou Reed cover,\n\nwhere this hand drawn typography resonated,\n\nand numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.\n\nYou know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,\n\nwhere one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.\n\nThe type in an instant, in a single image,\n\ntells the story of its making, tells you about its process,\n\nin a very elegant way, in a very fast way.\n\nThat typography strangely became so well\nknown, just within the design community\n\nof course, that some people thought that&#39;s all we do,\n\nwhich thankfully is not the case.\n\nWell, I always thought that approach of people\nusing only three or four typefaces very suspect.\n\nI think this could be interesting to do for a single project\n\nas an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.\n\nBut as a strategy over a lifetime\n\nI think it&#39;s akin to a writer saying,\n\nI&#39;m only going to write in three or four words.\n\nYes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,\n\nand for the second would it really yield an\ninteresting body of work over a lifetime?\n\nDesigners wanted to express their subjectivity,\n\ntheir own feelings about the world,\n\ntheir sense that they had something to say through design,\n\nthrough the design choices they made.\n\nAnd of course this caused controversy.\n\nlf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,\nwho&#39;d been one of the Sixties&#39; high priests,\n\nwith his company Unimark,\n\nit&#39;s right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.\n\nWhen he looked at this new work,\n\nthis expressive, subjective, wayward,\n\nto his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,\n\nlt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,\n\nbut they&#39;d stormed through and they&#39;d taken over.\n\nln the &#39;70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,\n\nand all the junk that you could find.\n\nAnd also in the &#39;80s, with their minds completely confused\n\nby that. . . disease that was called Postmodernism,\n\npeople were just going around like\nchickens without their heads,\n\nby using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say &#39;&#39;not modern&#39;&#39;.\n\nThey didn&#39;t know what they were caring for,\n\nthey only knew about what they were against.\n\nAnd what they were against was Helvetica.\n\nI had no formal training in the field,\n\nln my case I never learned all the things l wasn&#39;t supposed to do.\n\nI just did what made sense to me.\n\nI was just experimenting really.\n\nSo when people started getting really upset, I didn&#39;t really understand why.\n\nl&#39;d say, &#39;&#39;What&#39;s the big deal? What are you talking about?&#39;&#39;\n\nAnd it was many years later that somebody explained to me,\n\nprobably better than I can explain it now,\n\nis that basically there was this group that\nspent a lot of time trying to organize things,\n\nand get some kind of system going,\n\nand they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.\n\nWhich I might have done, but it wasn&#39;t the starting point\n\nand it wasn&#39;t the plan.\n\nOnly much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.\n\nRaygun Magazine was very much experimental,\n\nit was completely experimental. Every issue we&#39;d try a lot of things\n\nand a lot of them worked,\n\nand a lot of them didn&#39;t work.\n\nI never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,\n\nflat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on\n\nwhy I did this black type on a black boot, or something.\n\nNo, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?\n\nlt&#39;s very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.\n\nYou know, I can teach anybody off the street\n\nhow to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.\n\nBut if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD\n\nand say, &#39;&#39;Okay, now let&#39;s interpret that music for a cover,\n\nwell 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost\n\nand are going to do something corny and expected,\n\nand one person is going to do something amazing\n\nbecause that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction\n\nthat nobody else could go. And that&#39;s the\narea to me where it gets more interesting\n\nand exciting, and more emotional.\n\nAnd that&#39;s where the best work comes from.\n\nThis is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,\n\nand when I read the article it was very\nmuch like so many of these others I had read,\n\nand I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.\n\nAnd I went through all my fonts, which at\nthe time would&#39;ve been hundreds and hundreds,\n\nuhm, well, it still is for that matter, and\n\ndidn&#39;t find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.\n\nAnd I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,\n\nwhich of course now it&#39;s Zapf Dingbats so it&#39;s literally the last one.\n\nAnd I was like, well it&#39;s boring and not worth reading,\n\nwhy not do it in Zapf Dingbats?\n\nlt&#39;s a font. So it&#39;s all set in Dingbats,\n\nit is the actual font, you could highlight it\nand make it Helvetica or something\n\nand you&#39;d be able to read it\n\nbut it really wouldn&#39;t be worthwhile, it&#39;s not very well-written.\n\nDon&#39;t confuse legibility with communication.\n\nJust because something&#39;s legible, doesn&#39;t mean it communicates\n\nAnd more importantly doesn&#39;t mean it communicates the right thing.\n\nAnd vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read\n\ncould be sending a completely different message\n\nthat is valid for where it&#39;s being used,\n\nand that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.\n\nBut it almost seems stronger the other way,\n\nif something is a very important message\nand it&#39;s set in a boring, non-descript way,\n\nthe message can be lost.\n\nI mean that doesn&#39;t say &#39;&#39;caffeinated&#39;&#39;!\n\nIt&#39;s just like, hello?\n\n|Why Not?|\n\nIt&#39;s just sitting there! There&#39;s nothing caffeinated about it!\n\nThere&#39;s nothing &#39;&#39;extramarital&#39;&#39; about that.\n\nThere&#39;s no &#39;&#39;sunshine&#39;&#39; here.\n\nThat&#39;s no fun, that&#39;s not a fun sandlot.\n\nWhere&#39;s the explosion?\n\nThis could be the first date.\n\nThis might be close, these buses are kind of boring.\n\nThere&#39;s a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,\nand simple and clean and boring.\n\nThat was sort of the rise of what&#39;s referred to as grunge typography,\n\nand that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years\n\nas that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it\n\nto anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes\n\nand all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,\n\nwhich is how they looked the day before.\n\nTypography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,\n\njust lying there in a twisted heap,\n\nall rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,\n\nthat all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back\n\nto return to an earlier way of designing,\n\nbut with a new set of theories to support it.\n\nFor us, modernism does have a more subversive side.\n\nI think that the whole image of modernism\n\nas something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,\n\nutilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,\n\nthat is a sort of a late-modernist thing.\n\nI think the early-modernist movements,\n\nlike Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,\n\nall had their more subversive sides\n\nand their more, how do you call it,\n\ndialectical sides, so they went against something.\n\nIt&#39;s not that we are against that experimentation\n\nthat people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.\n\nWe think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.\n\nAll that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,\n\nand I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed\n\nbecause you wanted to use a certain\ntypeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,\n\nand then you couldn&#39;t use it because you wanted to be original.\n\nAnd with Helvetica this whole problem is\nnon-existent because everybody&#39;s using Helvetica.\n\nA lot of people see the way a young generation of\ndesigners uses a typeface such as Helvetica\n\nas a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.\n\nI think we would very much disagree with that.\n\nI think all three of us grew up in the &#39;70s\n\nin the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.\n\nFor example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,\n\nthe logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,\n\nthe stamps were designed by Crouwel,\n\nthe telephone book was designed by Crouwel,\n\nthe atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.\n\nSo for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,\n\nthat&#39;s something really natural.\n\nIt&#39;s not that we ... I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it\n\nfrom books and then copy it or something, but\n\nI would really say that it&#39;s almost in our blood.\n\nIt&#39;s also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica\n\nsometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.\n\nI&#39;m not afraid for that quality at all\n\nbecause I&#39;m just know that everybody can put a twist on it.\n\nI think you can put as much nationality\nin the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.\n\nAnd I think the way people like Crouwel\nuse Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,\n\nand that&#39;s why I&#39;m never really impressed with the argument\n\nthat Helvetica is a sort of global monster.\n\nI&#39;m not one of those people who is a real typographer,\n\nI don&#39;t know all the fancy words for all the letters,\n\nand the sort of ligatures and ascenders\nand descenders and all that kind of thing.\n\nI just more, sort of, react to certain things,\n\nand just do what I feel is right,\n\nso I&#39;m never sort of a classical type guy.\n\nSo I get obsessed about things, I collect things,\n\nyou know, I&#39;ve got so many bits and scraps\nof paper, of things that you find on the street,\n\nor wrappers. It&#39;s just making something\nbeautiful out of something very ordinary.\n\nThat&#39;s what I really enjoy, the ordinary things\n\nthat most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.\n\nThe biggest thing for me in terms of design\n\nis to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.\n\nThat&#39;s some of the best design, I think.\n\nI see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,\n\nI wish I&#39;d done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.\n\nOr you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that&#39;s nice.\n\nIt&#39;s all about that emotional response.\n\nOne of the things I&#39;ve always really wanted to design is airplane signage,\n\nan identity for an airline.\n\nI&#39;d love to do the uniforms, or you know,\nseats and the whole thing, the trucks and\n\nthat kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.\n\nYou know, I&#39;ve done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;\n\nI want to go a little bit bigger scale now.\n\nIt&#39;s that idea that something&#39;s designed to stand the test of time,\n\nand hopefully some of the things I&#39;m\ndesigning will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.\n\nI&#39;d love to think that.\n\nI got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,\n\nwhich believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.\n\nI&#39;ve done other people&#39;s wedding invites, and I&#39;ll never do one again.\n\nIt&#39;s the most stressful job I&#39;ve ever had,\n\ndealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,\n\nand on the order of service\n\nI did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.\n\nBut my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.\n\nBut it was funny . . .\n\nI think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.\n\nI always really enjoy using Helvetica\n\nbecause . . .some people say they use a\ndifferent typeface because it gives a different feeling.\n\nAnd I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.\n\nIt&#39;s been around for fifty years, coming up,\n\nand it&#39;s just as fresh as it was . . . obviously,\nit wasn&#39;t intended to be this cool thing,\n\nbut it&#39;s just a beautiful font.\n\nWell, we are less obsessed with Helvetica\n\nthan we used to be.\n\nYes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.\n\nWe accepted it somehow ... We came to a\npoint where we accepted that it&#39;s just there.\n\nWe like restrictions.\n\nWe can&#39;t operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.\n\nThe more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.\n\nWhen we started school,\n\nthe influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.\n\nIt&#39;s only after that we really looked at Josef\n\nwork, and &#39;60s Swiss Typography.\n\nWhen we started the office we really said\n\nwe wanted to look back,\n\nto find more structured design.\n\nFor us it&#39;s very important to reduce the elements we use.\n\nWhen it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,\n\nor two, and if possible we will use one size.\n\nWe don&#39;t like humanistic typefaces for example,\n\nit must be more rational\n\nbecause otherwise it has too much expression.\n\nWe think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.\n\nIt will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also\n\none of the secrets of the success of Helvetica\n\nthat in itself it is already\n\nit has a certain style, a certain aesthetic\n\nthat you will just use it like that,\n\nbecause of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.\n\nYou wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.\n\nIf you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,\n\njust use Helvetica Bold in one size,\n\nlike for a flyer. . . it looks good.\n\nSo it may very well be that when it comes to trends,\n\nat least in graphic design, we&#39;ve reached sort of the end of history.\n\nThe pendulum that swings back and forth\ndoesn&#39;t have any more directions it can swing in.\n\nThe final trend may simply be the completely\ndemocratic distribution of the means of production\n\nto anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.\n\nYou can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,\n\nyou can have a film studio for ten grand,\n\nyou definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,\n\nand have basically\n\nsimilar tools as the people who do this for a living.\n\nIf all these people have the tools to make good design,\n\nthey realize that it ain&#39;t that easy.\n\nIt&#39;s not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.\n\nIt&#39;s not about having the latest version of whatever program.\n\nIf you don&#39;t have the eye, if you don&#39;t a sense of design,\n\nthe program&#39;s not going to give it to you.\n\nI remember, years ago, a friend of mine\nwho produced radio commercials\n\nhad five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records\n\nand sing the beginning of &#39;&#39;Round Round Get Around, I Get Around&#39;&#39;\n\nby the Beach Boys.\n\nAnd they really tried, they rehearsed for a\nweek to get their harmonies right,\n\nand they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,\n\nand they loved music.\n\nAnd they went out and they sang it,\n\nand of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly...\n\nterrible. But they&#39;d rehearsed. And then\n\nthe voiceover for the commercial said,\n&#39;&#39;Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.&#39;&#39;\n\nAnd it&#39;s really sort of the same thing.\n\nThe closer you come to it, and the more you see it,\n\nthe more you appreciate it when it&#39;s terrific.\n\nThere are more good, young type designers\n\nnow, by young I mean probably late\ntwenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.\n\nSo who knows what typefaces they will design\n\nin terms of style and so on. But they&#39;ll be good.\n\nAnd to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,\n\na huge benefit that comes with this more\ndemocratic, more accessible technology.\n\nThere&#39;s just something about Helvetica.\n\nSomething about the fact that people keep\nsaying I&#39;ve come up with an improvement of Helvetica.\n\nAnd it never is really good.\n\nYou know, I wonder whether or not somehow there&#39;s\nsome whole undiscovered science of typography\n\nthat would sort of say it&#39;s not just because we&#39;re used to seeing it,\n\nit&#39;s not just because it was associated with all these things\n\nthat we consider authoritative,\n\nbut it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.\n\nYou know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,\n\nthe rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,\n\nthe rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.\n\nI mean, I wouldn&#39;t have believed that those\nthings actually could be right or wrong\n\nas opposed to someone&#39;s tastes.\n\nYet we sort of have nearly fifty years of\nhistory of the thing just sitting there\n\ndaring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.\n\nIt&#39;s always changing, time is changing,\n\nthe appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.\n\nWhy you grab a certain typeface for a certain job\n\nhas a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.\n\nYou are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.\n\nWhat we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication\n\nand graphic design, if we still want to call it that,\n\nis accepted by many more people.\n\nThey get it. They understand it. They&#39;re starting to see graphic communication\n\nas an expression of their own identity.\n\nAnd the classic case of this is the social networking programs\n\nsuch as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.\n\nYou can change the background, you can put pictures in,\n\nyou can change the typeface to anything you want,\n\nand those choices, those decisions you make,\n\nbecome expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way\n\nyou care about the clothing you&#39;re wearing as an expression of who you are,\n\nor your haircut or whatever,\n\nor how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.\n\nYou know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,\n\nthrough these consumer choices.\n\nWell, now it&#39;s happening in the sphere of visual communication\n\nand there&#39;s no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated,\n\nwhy this just won&#39;t go on developing, devoloping and developing.&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-eomsrdgo&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;MarkdownRenderer&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}"></astro-island> <!-- 2. 无 JS 时的回退 --> <div class="fallback-content" data-astro-cid-eomsrdgo> <h3 id="传奇字体-helvetica2007">《传奇字体 Helvetica》——2007</h3>
<p><strong>介绍：</strong>
你可能没听过Helvetica，但你一定见过它，而且每天都要见个好几次，如果你有iPhone，说不定一天会看见它几十次甚至上百次。 Helvetica 存在于我们的周遭，却让人浑然不觉。不过对某一群人来说，Helvetica 绝对是耳熟能详的字眼。对他们而言，Helvetica 是老师、是朋友，同时也是敌人，Helvetica 是个摆脱不去的枷锁。</p>
<p>这群人是平面设计师与字体设计师（当然还有很多我没提到的，例如网页设计师、app 开发者）。而Helvetica 是一款字体的名字，一款被大量使用的字体。</p>
<p>2007年，传奇字体「Helvetica」诞生满五十周年。独立制片人，同时也是本片导演Gary Hustwit 拍摄这部以字体Helvetica 为主题的纪录片，他的理由很简单：「因为它就在我们的身边。」</p>
<p>Type is saying things to us all the time.</p>
<p>Typefaces express a mood,an atmosphere,</p>
<p>they give words a certain coloring.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, you see typefaces.</p>
<p>But there’s probably one you see more than any other one, and that’s Helvetica.</p>
<p>You know, there it is, and it just seems to come from nowhere.</p>
<p>lt seems like air, it seems like gravity.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to evaluate it,</p>
<p>it’s like being asked what you think about off-white paint,</p>
<p>it’s just, there.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to get your head around something that big.</p>
<p>Most people who use Helvetica use it because it’s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>lt’s like going to McDonalds instead of thinking about food.</p>
<p>Because it’s there, it’s on every street corner.</p>
<p>So let’s eat crap, because it’s on the corner.</p>
<p>For me, Helvetica’s just this beautiful, timeless thing.</p>
<p>And certain things shouldn’t be messed with, you know?</p>
<p>Graphic design is the communication framework,</p>
<p>through which these messages, about what the world is now</p>
<p>and what we should aspire to,</p>
<p>it’s the way they reach us.</p>
<p>The designer has an enormous responsibility,</p>
<p>those are the people putting their wires into our heads.</p>
<p>Now should l talk? Should l not talk?</p>
<p>You want me to say something?</p>
<p>Say something, say nothing?</p>
<p>The life of a designer is a life of fight:</p>
<p>fight against the ugliness.</p>
<p>Just like a doctor fights against disease.</p>
<p>For us, the visual disease is what we have around,</p>
<p>and what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.</p>
<p>A good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the letters.</p>
<p>We think typography is black and white.</p>
<p>Typography is really white, it’s not even black.</p>
<p>lt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.</p>
<p>ln a sense it’s like music,</p>
<p>it’s not the notes, it’s the space you put between the notes that makes the music.</p>
<p>For instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.</p>
<p>This was done in 1966,</p>
<p>and the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two</p>
<p>American Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,</p>
<p>half red and half blue, just separated by the color.</p>
<p>What could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it’s perfect.</p>
<p>lt’s the only airline in the last forty years that has</p>
<p>not changed their identity.</p>
<p>All the airlines coming and going and changing…
American Airlines is still the same. There’s no need to change,</p>
<p>and how can they improve it?</p>
<p>They got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.</p>
<p>We always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.</p>
<p>lt’s not that we don’t believe in type.</p>
<p>We believe there are not that many good typefaces.</p>
<p>lf l want to be really generous there’s a dozen,</p>
<p>basically l use no more than three.</p>
<p>There are people that think that type should be expressive.</p>
<p>They have a different point of view than mine.</p>
<p>l don’t think type should be expressive at all.</p>
<p>l can write the word ‘dog’ with any typeface</p>
<p>and it doesn’t have to look like a dog.</p>
<p>But there are people that think when they write ‘dog’ it should bark!</p>
<p>What Helvetica is: it’s a typeface that was generated</p>
<p>by a desire of having better legibility.</p>
<p>lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.</p>
<p>lt’s good for everything, pretty much.</p>
<p>You can say l love you in Helvetica.</p>
<p>And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.</p>
<p>Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it’s really
intensive and passionate,</p>
<p>and it might work.</p>
<p>You can also say l hate you.</p>
<p>l can write … l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that …</p>
<p>to Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.</p>
<p>When Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.</p>
<p>lt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,</p>
<p>for anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.</p>
<p>The 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.</p>
<p>ln that postwar period,</p>
<p>after the horror and the cataclysm of the Second World War,</p>
<p>there’s a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,</p>
<p>across the world, certainly in Europe,</p>
<p>that design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,</p>
<p>to make things more open,</p>
<p>make them run more smoothly, be more democratic.</p>
<p>There was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.</p>
<p>And this is the period when the early
experiments of the high Modernist period</p>
<p>start to be broken down, rationalized, codified,</p>
<p>you get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style</p>
<p>or Swiss style.</p>
<p>And it’s Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.</p>
<p>This is where Helvetica comes in.</p>
<p>Helvetica emerges in that period, in 1957,</p>
<p>where there’s felt to be a need for rational typefaces</p>
<p>which can be applied to all kinds of contemporary information,</p>
<p>whether it’s sign systems or corporate identity</p>
<p>and present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public</p>
<p>in an intelligible, legible way.</p>
<p>So, it’s underpinned, is what l’m saying</p>
<p>by this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.</p>
<p>l’m a Modernist, you know.</p>
<p>l was trained in that period,</p>
<p>l lived in that period. l love Modernism.</p>
<p>l go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.</p>
<p>l want it, you know.</p>
<p>And well, that’s my life.</p>
<p>l’m surrounded with furniture from that period. l can’t change myself any more.</p>
<p>But if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,</p>
<p>the other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,</p>
<p>l’m not … l don’t like that.</p>
<p>l’m always interested in clarity.</p>
<p>lt should be clear,</p>
<p>it should be readable, it should be straightforward.</p>
<p>So l started using, gradually, grids for my design,</p>
<p>for my catalogues for museums.</p>
<p>l invented a grid, and within the grid</p>
<p>l played my game.</p>
<p>But always along the lines of the grid,</p>
<p>so that there is a certain order in it.</p>
<p>That’s why l use grids,</p>
<p>that’s why they call me ”Gridnik.”</p>
<p>For me, it’s a tool of creating order,</p>
<p>and creating order is typography.</p>
<p>l started late with the computer.</p>
<p>l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer</p>
<p>and l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well</p>
<p>but not like the young people.</p>
<p>l am slow with it and l can do it.</p>
<p>But l’m very much interested and</p>
<p>l would have liked to have in the sixties the computer</p>
<p>because we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,</p>
<p>and especially all the layers you can bring into your work.</p>
<p>We had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.</p>
<p>You need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques</p>
<p>and working on a poster took us days.</p>
<p>And now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations</p>
<p>and make a good choice.</p>
<p>You can’t do better design with a computer,</p>
<p>but you can speed up your work enormously.</p>
<p>Shall l begin?</p>
<p>l made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.</p>
<p>ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,</p>
<p>l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,
one of the artists of the Stijl movement.</p>
<p>Then l decided for the final designs</p>
<p>not to use these typefaces because the
illustration is already from that period,</p>
<p>and l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.</p>
<p>Helvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.</p>
<p>lt was a little more machined,</p>
<p>it was doing away with these manual details in it,</p>
<p>and we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.</p>
<p>And neutralism was a word that we loved.</p>
<p>lt should be neutral;</p>
<p>it shouldn’t have a meaning in itself. lt should …</p>
<p>the meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.</p>
<p>That’s why we loved Helvetica very much.</p>
<p>l have to say that for a lot of my life</p>
<p>l rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone…</p>
<p>you know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane</p>
<p>or a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do</p>
<p>and if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.</p>
<p>Occasionally, someone will actually know the term</p>
<p>but then will say, ”l thought they were all dead.”</p>
<p>Since l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,</p>
<p>particularly Verdana and Georgia,</p>
<p>l’ve had quite comical encounters with people who will say,</p>
<p>”Oh, you work with fonts.</p>
<p>We just got this memo round the office
saying we’ve all got to start using something called Verdana.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of it?”</p>
<p>Funny conversations that never would have happened to me
thirty, forty years ago.</p>
<p>My dad was a typographer, and although he didn’t push me to follow in his footsteps</p>
<p>when l left school, high school in the UK, l
had a year to fill before going to university</p>
<p>and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,</p>
<p>to a type foundry in the Netherlands,</p>
<p>where l spent a year learning what turned
out to be a completely obsolete trade</p>
<p>of making type by hand.</p>
<p>lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.</p>
<p>You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.</p>
<p>So, you know, l could say that really l’ve made type by practically all the means</p>
<p>it’s ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l’ve been working.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to generalize about the way type designers work.</p>
<p>There isn’t a generality of us.</p>
<p>But l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair</p>
<p>would essentially start in much the same way.</p>
<p>l’d probably start with a lowercase h.</p>
<p>it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.</p>
<p>lf it were a serif face it would look like this</p>
<p>here are the serifs so called, these little feet</p>
<p>on the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.</p>
<p>Are they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,</p>
<p>is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;</p>
<p>what are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,</p>
<p>and the x-height part of it,</p>
<p>Then because an h is a straight-sided letter,</p>
<p>l would then do a round letter like an o along side it.</p>
<p>l can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o
relates to the straight part of the h.</p>
<p>And already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.</p>
<p>l’d then probably do something like a lowercase p</p>
<p>because it’s half straight and half round;</p>
<p>and also it has a descending stroke,</p>
<p>which is another vertical dimension that l
would be interested in establishing.</p>
<p>Then l would then build on that.</p>
<p>lf you’ve got an h you’ve got an awful lot of information</p>
<p>about m, n, and u in the lower case.</p>
<p>lf you’ve got a p you’ve got q and b and d and so on.</p>
<p>And then just as soon as possible l would get them into words</p>
<p>or something that looked like words</p>
<p>because for me the experience of reading
something is so critical in judging it as a typeface</p>
<p>because l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic and to my
mind beautiful things about Helvetica</p>
<p>is these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.</p>
<p>The whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.</p>
<p>It’s very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,</p>
<p>how would l improve them? How would l make them any different?</p>
<p>They just seem to be exactly right.</p>
<p>l’m glad no one asked me to</p>
<p>second-guess Helvetica</p>
<p>because l wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>This is the original type specimen of Helvetica</p>
<p>before it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.</p>
<p>The whole story of how Helvetica came into being</p>
<p>is not entirely clear, at least to me.</p>
<p>lt is said, and l think it’s true,</p>
<p>that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,</p>
<p>wished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,</p>
<p>which was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,</p>
<p>and his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.</p>
<p>And it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.</p>
<p>l received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies</p>
<p>that Hoffmann’s part in this was a very much more significant one</p>
<p>than you might just assume by reading in a textbook</p>
<p>that Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.</p>
<p>You can easily say this was a joint product</p>
<p>of both Miedinger and my father.</p>
<p>Miedinger couldn’t produce a typeface alone;</p>
<p>neither could my father.</p>
<p>But when both were working hard together then something good resulted.</p>
<p>Here are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,</p>
<p>which was the first name of Helvetica.</p>
<p>l knew the way things worked at Haas</p>
<p>and l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,</p>
<p>and his almost pathological shyness</p>
<p>and the way that he would use other people’s hands.</p>
<p>But boy could you see his mind at work on the faces</p>
<p>where he was deeply involved.</p>
<p>You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann</p>
<p>indicating all the desired corrections.</p>
<p>”The capital Y is too slim.</p>
<p>The capital A is also too slim.”</p>
<p>When you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,</p>
<p>what it’s all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape</p>
<p>the figure-ground relationship,</p>
<p>the shapes between characters and within characters,</p>
<p>with the black if you like, with the inked surface.</p>
<p>And the Swiss pay more attention to the background,</p>
<p>so that the counters and the space
between characters just hold the letters.</p>
<p>l mean you can’t imagine anything moving;</p>
<p>it is so firm.</p>
<p>lt’s not a letter that’s bent to shape;</p>
<p>it’s a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.</p>
<p>lt’s … oh it’s brilliant when it’s done well.</p>
<p>My father had clear ideas</p>
<p>how the typeface should look.</p>
<p>So my father and Miedinger sat together,
and he started drawing.</p>
<p>Here you have a proof of an alphabet</p>
<p>with observations by Max Miedinger.</p>
<p>When Miedinger worked for Haas he did
not work as a designer.</p>
<p>He was actually a salesman.</p>
<p>His job was to travel around Switzerland</p>
<p>taking orders for fonts of type.</p>
<p>By profession he was a graphic artist,</p>
<p>but he realized that he could make more
money by selling foundry type.</p>
<p>But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of
a new typeface, l’m sure that you could design it.</p>
<p>l have here a type specimen book</p>
<p>of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.</p>
<p>You have to know that Haas was
controlled by the German type foundry Stempel.</p>
<p>And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.</p>
<p>Now we go down to the cellar and see in
our archives where we can find Helvetica.</p>
<p>Here we have number 24.</p>
<p>And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.</p>
<p>The marketing director at Stempel had the
idea to give it a better name</p>
<p>because Neue Haas Grotesk didn’t sound very good for a</p>
<p>typeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.</p>
<p>Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.</p>
<p>This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.</p>
<p>My father said, That’s impossible.</p>
<p>You cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.</p>
<p>So he said, why don’t you call it Helvetica.</p>
<p>So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.</p>
<p>And they agreed.</p>
<p>l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.</p>
<p>Swiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.</p>
<p>So it was the best solution for Helvetica</p>
<p>to get into the market.</p>
<p>Once we’d introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.</p>
<p>lt was exactly what the designers were looking for.</p>
<p>l mean, l don’t think there’s been such a hot thing since</p>
<p>as the figure-ground relationship properly executed</p>
<p>and it was… oh, just a landslide waiting to
go down the mountain.</p>
<p>And away it went.</p>
<p>l imagine there was a time when it just felt so good</p>
<p>to take something that was old and dusty
and homemade and crappy looking</p>
<p>and replace it with Helvetica.</p>
<p>lt just must have felt like you were scraping
the crud off of like filthy old things</p>
<p>and restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact</p>
<p>corporate identity in the sixties, that’s what
it sort of consisted of.</p>
<p>Clients would come in and they’d have
piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties</p>
<p>that hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.</p>
<p>They’d have some letterhead that would
say Amalgamated Widget on the top</p>
<p>in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,
above Amalgamated Widget</p>
<p>it would have an engraving showing their headquarters</p>
<p>in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke</p>
<p>you know, and then you go to a corporate
identity consultant circa 1965, 1966,</p>
<p>and they would take that and lay it here
and say, Here’s your current stationery,</p>
<p>and all it implies, and this is what we’re proposing.</p>
<p>And next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and</p>
<p>the nuptial script and the ivory paper,</p>
<p>they’d have a crisp bright white piece of paper</p>
<p>and instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,</p>
<p>it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium</p>
<p>Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?</p>
<p>That must have seemed like you’d crawled through a desert</p>
<p>with your mouth just caked with filthy dust</p>
<p>and then someone is offering you a clear,
refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water</p>
<p>to clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.</p>
<p>lt must have been just fantastic. And you
know it must have been fantastic</p>
<p>because it was done over and over and over again.</p>
<p>So this is what l’m talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.</p>
<p>One ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every
single visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.</p>
<p>You’ve got zany hand lettering everywhere,</p>
<p>swash typography to signify elegance,</p>
<p>exclamation points, exclamation points,
exclamation points.</p>
<p>Cursive wedding invitation typography
down here reading,</p>
<p>”Almost everyone appreciates the best.”</p>
<p>This was everywhere in the Fifties, this is
how everything looked in the Fifties.</p>
<p>You cut to - this is after Helvetica was in
full swing - same product.</p>
<p>No people, no smiling fakery,</p>
<p>just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.</p>
<p>The slogan underneath: lt’s the Real Thing,</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>Coke, period.</p>
<p>ln Helvetica, period.</p>
<p>Any questions? Of course not. Drink Coke, period.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Governments and corporations love Helvetica</p>
<p>because on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,</p>
<p>but also the smoothness of the letters
makes them seem almost human.</p>
<p>That is a quality they all want to convey</p>
<p>because of course they have the image they are always fighting</p>
<p>that they are authoritarian they’re bureaucratic,</p>
<p>you lose yourself in them, they’re oppressive.</p>
<p>So instead, by using Helvetica</p>
<p>they can come off seeming more
accessible, transparent, and accountable,</p>
<p>which are all the buzzwords for what corporations</p>
<p>and governments are supposed to be today.</p>
<p>Now they don’t have to be accessible or
accountable or transparent</p>
<p>but they can look that way.</p>
<p>Our tax forms from the lRS are in Helvetica.</p>
<p>The EPA uses it</p>
<p>now there’s someone who wants to look
clean and official and efficient.</p>
<p>Designers, and l think even readers, invest
so much of the surroundings in the typeface.</p>
<p>American Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.</p>
<p>American Airlines uses it and it looks sober.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a matter of the weight they
use and the letter spacing and the colors.</p>
<p>There’s something about the typeface l think
really invites this sort of open interpretation.</p>
<p>l suppose you could say the typefaces are either</p>
<p>those that are fully open to interpretation</p>
<p>or merely have one association attached to them.</p>
<p>A typeface made of icicles or candy canes
or something just says one thing.</p>
<p>And Helvetica maybe says everything.</p>
<p>And that’s perhaps part of its appeal.</p>
<p>Typography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.</p>
<p>Beyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.</p>
<p>I find when Tobias and I work on projects together</p>
<p>we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.</p>
<p>Working on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,</p>
<p>I remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.</p>
<p>lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti
typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.</p>
<p>I know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -</p>
<p>But it’s that there’s really no way to describe the qualitative parts
of a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.</p>
<p>And we’re constantly saying, You know,
this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;</p>
<p>it needs to be Debussy.</p>
<p>Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.</p>
<p>lt needs to be, you know, much more elegant… hand-lasted shoe.</p>
<p>l’ve been collecting these signs for a couple of years now</p>
<p>and one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.</p>
<p>This is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.</p>
<p>This actually functions so much more clearly</p>
<p>and so much more effectively than what we
see out on the street now.</p>
<p>The sort of classical modernist line on</p>
<p>how aware a reader should be of a typeface</p>
<p>is that they shouldn’t be aware of it at all.</p>
<p>lt should be this crystal goblet</p>
<p>there to just hold and display and organize</p>
<p>the information. But I don’t think it’s really quite as simple as that.</p>
<p>I think even if they’re not consciously</p>
<p>aware of the typeface they’re reading,
they’ll certainly be affected by it.</p>
<p>The same way that an actor that’s miscast
in a role will affect someone’s experience</p>
<p>of a movie or play that they’re watching.
They’ll still follow the plot,</p>
<p>but, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.</p>
<p>I think that typography is similar to that,</p>
<p>where the designer choosing typefaces is
essentially a casting director.</p>
<p>There’s very little type in my world outside of work.</p>
<p>Like everybody else I’m aware of fonts
being used in my environment.</p>
<p>You know, the standing joke that graphic
designers can’t see historical movies</p>
<p>because the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.</p>
<p>lt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.</p>
<p>in our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place</p>
<p>that’s just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.</p>
<p>I remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from</p>
<p>the place with the bad letter spacing out front.</p>
<p>Nobody doesn’t know what Helvetica is,</p>
<p>I mean, at the beginning of our careers
certainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,</p>
<p>no one knew what fonts were.</p>
<p>I think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.</p>
<p>The fact that it’s been so heavily licensed</p>
<p>and made available through these very populist technologies</p>
<p>has kind of furthered the mythology that it’s
the ultimate typeface in some way.</p>
<p>And even for us professionals that’s hard to escape from.</p>
<p>I kind of find myself buying into the idea</p>
<p>that ”Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years</p>
<p>and the ultimate expression was Helvetica.”</p>
<p>And realizing, wait a minute that’s not quite true, historically</p>
<p>or aesthetically or culturally or politically.</p>
<p>But there’s something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,</p>
<p>and perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.</p>
<p>I’m obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.</p>
<p>I can’t explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,</p>
<p>I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.</p>
<p>Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls’ bottoms,</p>
<p>I get kicks out of looking at type.</p>
<p>lt’s a little worrying I must admit, it’s a very nerdish thing to do.</p>
<p>I’m very much a word person.</p>
<p>So that’s why typography for me is the obvious extension.</p>
<p>lt just makes my words visible.</p>
<p>A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.</p>
<p>That’s why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.</p>
<p>And I’m sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica</p>
<p>or anything that would be considered legible.</p>
<p>But we can read it because there’s a rhythm to it, there’s a contrast to it.</p>
<p>Helvetica hasn’t got any of that.</p>
<p>|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|</p>
<p>I don’t know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?</p>
<p>No, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.</p>
<p>lt really answered a demand.</p>
<p>But now it’s become one of those defaults that,</p>
<p>partly because of the proliferation of the
computer, which is now twenty years,</p>
<p>the PC I mean,</p>
<p>it was the default on the Apple Macintosh
and then it became the default on Windows</p>
<p>which copied everything that Apple did, as you know.</p>
<p>lnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,</p>
<p>which is worse than Helvetica but</p>
<p>fills the same purpose I think. Now it’s probably never going to go away</p>
<p>because it’s ubiquitous; it’s a default. lt’s air,</p>
<p>you know, it’s just there. There’s no choice.</p>
<p>You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.</p>
<p>lt brings style with it; every typeface does.</p>
<p>lt has a certain,</p>
<p>well, it’s like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle</p>
<p>you’re not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You’d look like an idiot.</p>
<p>And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,</p>
<p>it needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;</p>
<p>it needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.</p>
<p>lt needs a lot of space sideways also.</p>
<p>Then it’s very legible, but</p>
<p>very small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,</p>
<p>it’s a nightmare, a total nightmare.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say this if I hadn’t tried it.</p>
<p>Because all the letters … it’s the whole Swiss ideology;</p>
<p>the guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.</p>
<p>Hello??? You know, that’s called an army. That’s not people.</p>
<p>That’s people having the same fucking helmet on.</p>
<p>lt doesn’t further individualism.</p>
<p>And the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough</p>
<p>so that it’s interesting,</p>
<p>but of course ninety-five percent of any
alphabet has to look like the other alphabet</p>
<p>otherwise you wouldn’t be able to read it.</p>
<p>l’ve never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,</p>
<p>you know, like some people … l’ve got to do this, and they go to their,</p>
<p>whatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.</p>
<p>I don’t have that urge.</p>
<p>You know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody puts their history into their work.</p>
<p>I certainly know that when I draw something it has</p>
<p>I’m fast, I’m loud, I’m chaotic,</p>
<p>I’m not very rule based, even though I’m German and I love rules,</p>
<p>I’m a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I’m all over the place essentially.</p>
<p>I’m always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>but then I’m on the second.</p>
<p>So I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.</p>
<p>They’re never perfect. They always have a little edge</p>
<p>in the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.</p>
<p>I know there’s people who hate me, who
would never use one of my typefaces in a million years</p>
<p>and vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design</p>
<p>not because it’s good for them or it fits the purpose,</p>
<p>simply because I did it.</p>
<p>I think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;</p>
<p>some of them are crap.</p>
<p>But I buy it because l’ve always bought their CDs</p>
<p>lch habe sie immer gekauft,</p>
<p>or their music.</p>
<p>Why do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.</p>
<p>And typefaces are a brand.</p>
<p>You’re telling an audience, This is for you,
by using a certain typographic voice.</p>
<p>You’d recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away</p>
<p>because they use a typeface that they only use</p>
<p>You can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it’s called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,</p>
<p>but Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.</p>
<p>You can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away</p>
<p>because of that stupid typeface.</p>
<p>lf they’d used Helvetica… Hello??? lt wouldn’t quite work.</p>
<p>The way something is presented will define the way you react to it.</p>
<p>So you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,</p>
<p>and the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.</p>
<p>And the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,</p>
<p>if you want, in that communication.</p>
<p>And I say weapon largely because with
commercial marketing and advertising,</p>
<p>the way a message is dressed is going to
define our reaction to that message in the advertising.</p>
<p>So if it says, buy these jeans, and it’s a grunge font,</p>
<p>you would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans</p>
<p>or to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.</p>
<p>lf you see that same message in Helvetica,</p>
<p>you know, it’s probably on sale at Gap.</p>
<p>You know it’s going to be clean, that you’re
going to fit in, you’re not going to stand out.</p>
<p>All of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.</p>
<p>Maybe the feeling you have when you see a particular
typographic choices used on a piece of packaging,</p>
<p>is just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that’s my kind of product.</p>
<p>But that’s the type casting its secret spell.</p>
<p>ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt’s a mark of membership;</p>
<p>it’s a badge that says we’re part of modern society,</p>
<p>we share the same ideals.</p>
<p>lt’s well-rounded, it’s not going to be damaging or dangerous.</p>
<p>Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,</p>
<p>and that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,</p>
<p>well not sort of, it is saying to us,</p>
<p>Don’t worry, any of the problems you’re having, or problems in the world,</p>
<p>538
00:42:26,010 —> 00:42:28,979
or problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,</p>
<p>all those problems aren’t going to spill over, they’ll be contained,</p>
<p>and in fact maybe they don’t exist.</p>
<p>What I like is if this very serious typeface</p>
<p>tells you the do’s and don’ts of street life,</p>
<p>and it must be Helvetica at that moment.</p>
<p>The image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface</p>
<p>made it the so-called typeface of capitalism,</p>
<p>which I would actually reject and say</p>
<p>it’s the typeface of socialism</p>
<p>because it is available all over and it’s
inviting dilettantes and amateurs and</p>
<p>everybody to do typography,</p>
<p>to create their own type designs, and l think that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>And I think I’m right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.</p>
<p>lt’s just something we don’t notice usually</p>
<p>but we would miss very much if it wouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>I think it’s quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status</p>
<p>in our lives</p>
<p>As is always the case with any style, there’s a law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The more you see it, the more the public sees it,</p>
<p>the more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,</p>
<p>the more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.</p>
<p>By the time I started as a designer, it sort
of seemed there was only one trick in town,</p>
<p>which was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.</p>
<p>You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.</p>
<p>And you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,</p>
<p>but it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much</p>
<p>and associated with so many big, faceless things</p>
<p>that it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.</p>
<p>And by the seventies, especially in America,</p>
<p>you start to get a reaction against,</p>
<p>what it seems to those designers is the conformity,</p>
<p>the kind of dull blanket of sameness</p>
<p>that this way of designing is imposing on the world.</p>
<p>So something that had come out of idealism</p>
<p>has by this time become merely routine, and there’s a need for a change.</p>
<p>You come into design,</p>
<p>at the point that you start out in history,</p>
<p>without knowing that you’re starting out in history,</p>
<p>and often you don’t have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,</p>
<p>and you certainly don’t know what’s going to come after.</p>
<p>And when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,</p>
<p>what struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.</p>
<p>One was the corporate culture,</p>
<p>and the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,</p>
<p>and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.</p>
<p>They looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.</p>
<p>They were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.</p>
<p>I felt like, this was some conspiracy of my
mother’s, to make me keep the house clean,</p>
<p>that all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me</p>
<p>in the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.</p>
<p>Hey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.</p>
<p>I also was morally opposed to Helvetica,</p>
<p>because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica</p>
<p>as sponsors of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>So therefore, if you used Helvetica,</p>
<p>it meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>so how could you use it?</p>
<p>What looked cool to me at that point were
record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,</p>
<p>the accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,</p>
<p>obviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.</p>
<p>Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,</p>
<p>everybody’s ambition. To work there, to do
work that was as inspiring as their work,</p>
<p>because it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,</p>
<p>aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make work that looked like that.</p>
<p>When I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,</p>
<p>and I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.</p>
<p>And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.</p>
<p>We would make book covers and record covers as school projects,</p>
<p>and l’d go to the local art store, l’d go to
Sam Flax, and l’d buy Helvetica as press type,</p>
<p>and l’d rub it down in the corner of the album
the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.</p>
<p>And of course it would never line up
properly and thing would crackle and break</p>
<p>and it’d be terrible.</p>
<p>And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,</p>
<p>and illustrate the type.</p>
<p>And it hadn’t dawned on me that typography could have personality</p>
<p>the way drawing did.</p>
<p>I realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,</p>
<p>and that it could be your own medium,</p>
<p>that it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,</p>
<p>and the title of the AlGA Annual was
Graphic Design U.S.A.</p>
<p>And I decided I would take the title literally</p>
<p>and sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,</p>
<p>so I decided what l’d do is list every state in the United States,</p>
<p>and the percentage of people who used Helvetica.</p>
<p>And I didn’t have any scientific evidence of knowing
what percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,</p>
<p>so I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.</p>
<p>So that the states that went for Reagan</p>
<p>all had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.</p>
<p>| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>what’s the typeface of this war? |</p>
<p>The lraqi War?</p>
<p>Helvetica.</p>
<p>Same time period, I mean it is, it’s the same, it repeated.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re there. Helvetica caused it.</p>
<p>And so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.</p>
<p>They wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design</p>
<p>the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it</p>
<p>and produce something that had vitality.</p>
<p>I myself got fairly disappointed</p>
<p>with Modernism in general.</p>
<p>lt simply became boring.</p>
<p>lf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space</p>
<p>that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top</p>
<p>and a little abstract logo on the bottom</p>
<p>and a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,</p>
<p>the overall communication that says to me is,</p>
<p>Do Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you</p>
<p>not just visually, but also in content</p>
<p>because the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.</p>
<p>I was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,</p>
<p>and I think through that experience got close to the album cover</p>
<p>and essentially I went to art school because of album covers.</p>
<p>I probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,</p>
<p>so you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.</p>
<p>ln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books</p>
<p>and deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.</p>
<p>lt just didn’t seem a very interesting task to do.</p>
<p>So here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,</p>
<p>we started to do our own type</p>
<p>and I think there was one instance, it was
for a Lou Reed cover,</p>
<p>where this hand drawn typography resonated,</p>
<p>and numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.</p>
<p>You know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,</p>
<p>where one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.</p>
<p>The type in an instant, in a single image,</p>
<p>tells the story of its making, tells you about its process,</p>
<p>in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.</p>
<p>That typography strangely became so well
known, just within the design community</p>
<p>of course, that some people thought that’s all we do,</p>
<p>which thankfully is not the case.</p>
<p>Well, I always thought that approach of people
using only three or four typefaces very suspect.</p>
<p>I think this could be interesting to do for a single project</p>
<p>as an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.</p>
<p>But as a strategy over a lifetime</p>
<p>I think it’s akin to a writer saying,</p>
<p>I’m only going to write in three or four words.</p>
<p>Yes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,</p>
<p>and for the second would it really yield an
interesting body of work over a lifetime?</p>
<p>Designers wanted to express their subjectivity,</p>
<p>their own feelings about the world,</p>
<p>their sense that they had something to say through design,</p>
<p>through the design choices they made.</p>
<p>And of course this caused controversy.</p>
<p>lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,
who’d been one of the Sixties’ high priests,</p>
<p>with his company Unimark,</p>
<p>it’s right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.</p>
<p>When he looked at this new work,</p>
<p>this expressive, subjective, wayward,</p>
<p>to his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,</p>
<p>lt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,</p>
<p>but they’d stormed through and they’d taken over.</p>
<p>ln the ’70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,</p>
<p>and all the junk that you could find.</p>
<p>And also in the ’80s, with their minds completely confused</p>
<p>by that… disease that was called Postmodernism,</p>
<p>people were just going around like
chickens without their heads,</p>
<p>by using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say ”not modern”.</p>
<p>They didn’t know what they were caring for,</p>
<p>they only knew about what they were against.</p>
<p>And what they were against was Helvetica.</p>
<p>I had no formal training in the field,</p>
<p>ln my case I never learned all the things l wasn’t supposed to do.</p>
<p>I just did what made sense to me.</p>
<p>I was just experimenting really.</p>
<p>So when people started getting really upset, I didn’t really understand why.</p>
<p>l’d say, ”What’s the big deal? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>And it was many years later that somebody explained to me,</p>
<p>probably better than I can explain it now,</p>
<p>is that basically there was this group that
spent a lot of time trying to organize things,</p>
<p>and get some kind of system going,</p>
<p>and they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.</p>
<p>Which I might have done, but it wasn’t the starting point</p>
<p>and it wasn’t the plan.</p>
<p>Only much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.</p>
<p>Raygun Magazine was very much experimental,</p>
<p>it was completely experimental. Every issue we’d try a lot of things</p>
<p>and a lot of them worked,</p>
<p>and a lot of them didn’t work.</p>
<p>I never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,</p>
<p>flat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on</p>
<p>why I did this black type on a black boot, or something.</p>
<p>No, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>lt’s very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.</p>
<p>You know, I can teach anybody off the street</p>
<p>how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.</p>
<p>But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD</p>
<p>and say, ”Okay, now let’s interpret that music for a cover,</p>
<p>well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost</p>
<p>and are going to do something corny and expected,</p>
<p>and one person is going to do something amazing</p>
<p>because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction</p>
<p>that nobody else could go. And that’s the
area to me where it gets more interesting</p>
<p>and exciting, and more emotional.</p>
<p>And that’s where the best work comes from.</p>
<p>This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,</p>
<p>and when I read the article it was very
much like so many of these others I had read,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.</p>
<p>And I went through all my fonts, which at
the time would’ve been hundreds and hundreds,</p>
<p>uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and</p>
<p>didn’t find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.</p>
<p>And I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,</p>
<p>which of course now it’s Zapf Dingbats so it’s literally the last one.</p>
<p>And I was like, well it’s boring and not worth reading,</p>
<p>why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?</p>
<p>lt’s a font. So it’s all set in Dingbats,</p>
<p>it is the actual font, you could highlight it
and make it Helvetica or something</p>
<p>and you’d be able to read it</p>
<p>but it really wouldn’t be worthwhile, it’s not very well-written.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse legibility with communication.</p>
<p>Just because something’s legible, doesn’t mean it communicates</p>
<p>And more importantly doesn’t mean it communicates the right thing.</p>
<p>And vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read</p>
<p>could be sending a completely different message</p>
<p>that is valid for where it’s being used,</p>
<p>and that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.</p>
<p>But it almost seems stronger the other way,</p>
<p>if something is a very important message
and it’s set in a boring, non-descript way,</p>
<p>the message can be lost.</p>
<p>I mean that doesn’t say ”caffeinated”!</p>
<p>It’s just like, hello?</p>
<p>|Why Not?|</p>
<p>It’s just sitting there! There’s nothing caffeinated about it!</p>
<p>There’s nothing ”extramarital” about that.</p>
<p>There’s no ”sunshine” here.</p>
<p>That’s no fun, that’s not a fun sandlot.</p>
<p>Where’s the explosion?</p>
<p>This could be the first date.</p>
<p>This might be close, these buses are kind of boring.</p>
<p>There’s a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,
and simple and clean and boring.</p>
<p>That was sort of the rise of what’s referred to as grunge typography,</p>
<p>and that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years</p>
<p>as that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it</p>
<p>to anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes</p>
<p>and all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,</p>
<p>which is how they looked the day before.</p>
<p>Typography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,</p>
<p>just lying there in a twisted heap,</p>
<p>all rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,</p>
<p>that all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back</p>
<p>to return to an earlier way of designing,</p>
<p>but with a new set of theories to support it.</p>
<p>For us, modernism does have a more subversive side.</p>
<p>I think that the whole image of modernism</p>
<p>as something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,</p>
<p>utilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,</p>
<p>that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.</p>
<p>I think the early-modernist movements,</p>
<p>like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,</p>
<p>all had their more subversive sides</p>
<p>and their more, how do you call it,</p>
<p>dialectical sides, so they went against something.</p>
<p>It’s not that we are against that experimentation</p>
<p>that people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.</p>
<p>We think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.</p>
<p>All that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,</p>
<p>and I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed</p>
<p>because you wanted to use a certain
typeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,</p>
<p>and then you couldn’t use it because you wanted to be original.</p>
<p>And with Helvetica this whole problem is
non-existent because everybody’s using Helvetica.</p>
<p>A lot of people see the way a young generation of
designers uses a typeface such as Helvetica</p>
<p>as a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.</p>
<p>I think we would very much disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think all three of us grew up in the ’70s</p>
<p>in the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.</p>
<p>For example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,</p>
<p>the logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,</p>
<p>the stamps were designed by Crouwel,</p>
<p>the telephone book was designed by Crouwel,</p>
<p>the atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.</p>
<p>So for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,</p>
<p>that’s something really natural.</p>
<p>It’s not that we … I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it</p>
<p>from books and then copy it or something, but</p>
<p>I would really say that it’s almost in our blood.</p>
<p>It’s also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica</p>
<p>sometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.</p>
<p>I’m not afraid for that quality at all</p>
<p>because I’m just know that everybody can put a twist on it.</p>
<p>I think you can put as much nationality
in the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.</p>
<p>And I think the way people like Crouwel
use Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,</p>
<p>and that’s why I’m never really impressed with the argument</p>
<p>that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.</p>
<p>I’m not one of those people who is a real typographer,</p>
<p>I don’t know all the fancy words for all the letters,</p>
<p>and the sort of ligatures and ascenders
and descenders and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I just more, sort of, react to certain things,</p>
<p>and just do what I feel is right,</p>
<p>so I’m never sort of a classical type guy.</p>
<p>So I get obsessed about things, I collect things,</p>
<p>you know, I’ve got so many bits and scraps
of paper, of things that you find on the street,</p>
<p>or wrappers. It’s just making something
beautiful out of something very ordinary.</p>
<p>That’s what I really enjoy, the ordinary things</p>
<p>that most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.</p>
<p>The biggest thing for me in terms of design</p>
<p>is to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.</p>
<p>That’s some of the best design, I think.</p>
<p>I see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,</p>
<p>I wish I’d done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.</p>
<p>Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that’s nice.</p>
<p>It’s all about that emotional response.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve always really wanted to design is airplane signage,</p>
<p>an identity for an airline.</p>
<p>I’d love to do the uniforms, or you know,
seats and the whole thing, the trucks and</p>
<p>that kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.</p>
<p>You know, I’ve done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;</p>
<p>I want to go a little bit bigger scale now.</p>
<p>It’s that idea that something’s designed to stand the test of time,</p>
<p>and hopefully some of the things I’m
designing will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.</p>
<p>I’d love to think that.</p>
<p>I got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,</p>
<p>which believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>I’ve done other people’s wedding invites, and I’ll never do one again.</p>
<p>It’s the most stressful job I’ve ever had,</p>
<p>dealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,</p>
<p>and on the order of service</p>
<p>I did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.</p>
<p>But my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.</p>
<p>But it was funny …</p>
<p>I think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.</p>
<p>I always really enjoy using Helvetica</p>
<p>because . . .some people say they use a
different typeface because it gives a different feeling.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.</p>
<p>It’s been around for fifty years, coming up,</p>
<p>and it’s just as fresh as it was … obviously,
it wasn’t intended to be this cool thing,</p>
<p>but it’s just a beautiful font.</p>
<p>Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica</p>
<p>than we used to be.</p>
<p>Yes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.</p>
<p>We accepted it somehow … We came to a
point where we accepted that it’s just there.</p>
<p>We like restrictions.</p>
<p>We can’t operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.</p>
<p>The more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.</p>
<p>When we started school,</p>
<p>the influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.</p>
<p>It’s only after that we really looked at Josef</p>
<p>work, and ’60s Swiss Typography.</p>
<p>When we started the office we really said</p>
<p>we wanted to look back,</p>
<p>to find more structured design.</p>
<p>For us it’s very important to reduce the elements we use.</p>
<p>When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,</p>
<p>or two, and if possible we will use one size.</p>
<p>We don’t like humanistic typefaces for example,</p>
<p>it must be more rational</p>
<p>because otherwise it has too much expression.</p>
<p>We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.</p>
<p>It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also</p>
<p>one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica</p>
<p>that in itself it is already</p>
<p>it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic</p>
<p>that you will just use it like that,</p>
<p>because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.</p>
<p>You wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.</p>
<p>If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,</p>
<p>just use Helvetica Bold in one size,</p>
<p>like for a flyer… it looks good.</p>
<p>So it may very well be that when it comes to trends,</p>
<p>at least in graphic design, we’ve reached sort of the end of history.</p>
<p>The pendulum that swings back and forth
doesn’t have any more directions it can swing in.</p>
<p>The final trend may simply be the completely
democratic distribution of the means of production</p>
<p>to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.</p>
<p>You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,</p>
<p>you can have a film studio for ten grand,</p>
<p>you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,</p>
<p>and have basically</p>
<p>similar tools as the people who do this for a living.</p>
<p>If all these people have the tools to make good design,</p>
<p>they realize that it ain’t that easy.</p>
<p>It’s not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.</p>
<p>It’s not about having the latest version of whatever program.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the eye, if you don’t a sense of design,</p>
<p>the program’s not going to give it to you.</p>
<p>I remember, years ago, a friend of mine
who produced radio commercials</p>
<p>had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records</p>
<p>and sing the beginning of ”Round Round Get Around, I Get Around”</p>
<p>by the Beach Boys.</p>
<p>And they really tried, they rehearsed for a
week to get their harmonies right,</p>
<p>and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,</p>
<p>and they loved music.</p>
<p>And they went out and they sang it,</p>
<p>and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly…</p>
<p>terrible. But they’d rehearsed. And then</p>
<p>the voiceover for the commercial said,
”Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.”</p>
<p>And it’s really sort of the same thing.</p>
<p>The closer you come to it, and the more you see it,</p>
<p>the more you appreciate it when it’s terrific.</p>
<p>There are more good, young type designers</p>
<p>now, by young I mean probably late
twenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.</p>
<p>So who knows what typefaces they will design</p>
<p>in terms of style and so on. But they’ll be good.</p>
<p>And to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,</p>
<p>a huge benefit that comes with this more
democratic, more accessible technology.</p>
<p>There’s just something about Helvetica.</p>
<p>Something about the fact that people keep
saying I’ve come up with an improvement of Helvetica.</p>
<p>And it never is really good.</p>
<p>You know, I wonder whether or not somehow there’s
some whole undiscovered science of typography</p>
<p>that would sort of say it’s not just because we’re used to seeing it,</p>
<p>it’s not just because it was associated with all these things</p>
<p>that we consider authoritative,</p>
<p>but it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.</p>
<p>You know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,</p>
<p>the rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,</p>
<p>the rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn’t have believed that those
things actually could be right or wrong</p>
<p>as opposed to someone’s tastes.</p>
<p>Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of
history of the thing just sitting there</p>
<p>daring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.</p>
<p>It’s always changing, time is changing,</p>
<p>the appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.</p>
<p>Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job</p>
<p>has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.</p>
<p>You are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.</p>
<p>What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication</p>
<p>and graphic design, if we still want to call it that,</p>
<p>is accepted by many more people.</p>
<p>They get it. They understand it. They’re starting to see graphic communication</p>
<p>as an expression of their own identity.</p>
<p>And the classic case of this is the social networking programs</p>
<p>such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.</p>
<p>You can change the background, you can put pictures in,</p>
<p>you can change the typeface to anything you want,</p>
<p>and those choices, those decisions you make,</p>
<p>become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way</p>
<p>you care about the clothing you’re wearing as an expression of who you are,</p>
<p>or your haircut or whatever,</p>
<p>or how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.</p>
<p>You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,</p>
<p>through these consumer choices.</p>
<p>Well, now it’s happening in the sphere of visual communication</p>
<p>and there’s no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated,</p>
<p>why this just won’t go on developing, devoloping and developing.</p> </div> </article>  </div> </main> <aside class="hidden lg:block sticky top-0 h-screen w-64 flex-shrink-0 py-8 pl-8"> <div
