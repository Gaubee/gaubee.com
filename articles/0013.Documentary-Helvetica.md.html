<p><strong>介绍：</strong>
你可能没听过Helvetica，但你一定见过它，而且每天都要见个好几次，如果你有iPhone，说不定一天会看见它几十次甚至上百次。 Helvetica 存在于我们的周遭，却让人浑然不觉。不过对某一群人来说，Helvetica 绝对是耳熟能详的字眼。对他们而言，Helvetica 是老师、是朋友，同时也是敌人，Helvetica 是个摆脱不去的枷锁。</p>
<p>这群人是平面设计师与字体设计师（当然还有很多我没提到的，例如网页设计师、app 开发者）。而Helvetica 是一款字体的名字，一款被大量使用的字体。</p>
<p>2007年，传奇字体「Helvetica」诞生满五十周年。独立制片人，同时也是本片导演Gary Hustwit 拍摄这部以字体Helvetica 为主题的纪录片，他的理由很简单：「因为它就在我们的身边。」</p>
<p>Type is saying things to us all the time.</p>
<p>Typefaces express a mood,an atmosphere,</p>
<p>they give words a certain coloring.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, you see typefaces.</p>
<p>But there’s probably one you see more than any other one, and that’s Helvetica.</p>
<p>You know, there it is, and it just seems to come from nowhere.</p>
<p>lt seems like air, it seems like gravity.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to evaluate it,</p>
<p>it’s like being asked what you think about off-white paint,</p>
<p>it’s just, there.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to get your head around something that big.</p>
<p>Most people who use Helvetica use it because it’s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>lt’s like going to McDonalds instead of thinking about food.</p>
<p>Because it’s there, it’s on every street corner.</p>
<p>So let’s eat crap, because it’s on the corner.</p>
<p>For me, Helvetica’s just this beautiful, timeless thing.</p>
<p>And certain things shouldn’t be messed with, you know?</p>
<p>Graphic design is the communication framework,</p>
<p>through which these messages, about what the world is now</p>
<p>and what we should aspire to,</p>
<p>it’s the way they reach us.</p>
<p>The designer has an enormous responsibility,</p>
<p>those are the people putting their wires into our heads.</p>
<p>Now should l talk? Should l not talk?</p>
<p>You want me to say something?</p>
<p>Say something, say nothing?</p>
<p>The life of a designer is a life of fight:</p>
<p>fight against the ugliness.</p>
<p>Just like a doctor fights against disease.</p>
<p>For us, the visual disease is what we have around,</p>
<p>and what we try to do is to cure it somehow, with design.</p>
<p>A good typographer always has sensitivity about the distance between the letters.</p>
<p>We think typography is black and white.</p>
<p>Typography is really white, it’s not even black.</p>
<p>lt is the space between the blacks that really makes it.</p>
<p>ln a sense it’s like music,</p>
<p>it’s not the notes, it’s the space you put between the notes that makes the music.</p>
<p>For instance, we designed the corporate identity for American Airlines.</p>
<p>This was done in 1966,</p>
<p>and the novelty at the time was the fact of making one word instead of two</p>
<p>American Airlines by making AmericanAirlines all one word,</p>
<p>half red and half blue, just separated by the color.</p>
<p>What could me more American than red and blue? You know, so it’s perfect.</p>
<p>lt’s the only airline in the last forty years that has</p>
<p>not changed their identity.</p>
<p>All the airlines coming and going and changing…
American Airlines is still the same. There’s no need to change,</p>
<p>and how can they improve it?</p>
<p>They got the best already: American Airlines in Helvetica.</p>
<p>We always had a tendency to use very few typefaces.</p>
<p>lt’s not that we don’t believe in type.</p>
<p>We believe there are not that many good typefaces.</p>
<p>lf l want to be really generous there’s a dozen,</p>
<p>basically l use no more than three.</p>
<p>There are people that think that type should be expressive.</p>
<p>They have a different point of view than mine.</p>
<p>l don’t think type should be expressive at all.</p>
<p>l can write the word ‘dog’ with any typeface</p>
<p>and it doesn’t have to look like a dog.</p>
<p>But there are people that think when they write ‘dog’ it should bark!</p>
<p>What Helvetica is: it’s a typeface that was generated</p>
<p>by a desire of having better legibility.</p>
<p>lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.</p>
<p>lt’s good for everything, pretty much.</p>
<p>You can say l love you in Helvetica.</p>
<p>And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy.</p>
<p>Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it’s really
intensive and passionate,</p>
<p>and it might work.</p>
<p>You can also say l hate you.</p>
<p>l can write … l certainly can write a few letters in Helvetica saying that …</p>
<p>to Washington D.C. in particular, if l can put it that way.</p>
<p>When Helvetica came about, we were all ready for it.</p>
<p>lt just had all the right connotations we were looking for,</p>
<p>for anything that had to spell out loud and clear: modern.</p>
<p>The 1950s is an interesting period in the development of graphic design.</p>
<p>ln that postwar period,</p>
<p>after the horror and the cataclysm of the Second World War,</p>
<p>there’s a real feeling of idealism among some designers, many perhaps,</p>
<p>across the world, certainly in Europe,</p>
<p>that design is part of that need to rebuild,to reconstruct,</p>
<p>to make things more open,</p>
<p>make them run more smoothly, be more democratic.</p>
<p>There was this real sense of social responsibility among designers.</p>
<p>And this is the period when the early
experiments of the high Modernist period</p>
<p>start to be broken down, rationalized, codified,</p>
<p>you get the emergence of this so-called international typographic style</p>
<p>or Swiss style.</p>
<p>And it’s Swiss designers in the 1950s who are really driving that along.</p>
<p>This is where Helvetica comes in.</p>
<p>Helvetica emerges in that period, in 1957,</p>
<p>where there’s felt to be a need for rational typefaces</p>
<p>which can be applied to all kinds of contemporary information,</p>
<p>whether it’s sign systems or corporate identity</p>
<p>and present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public</p>
<p>in an intelligible, legible way.</p>
<p>So, it’s underpinned, is what l’m saying</p>
<p>by this great feeling shared by many designers of idealism.</p>
<p>l’m a Modernist, you know.</p>
<p>l was trained in that period,</p>
<p>l lived in that period. l love Modernism.</p>
<p>l go next week to London to see the exhibition of Modernism.</p>
<p>l want it, you know.</p>
<p>And well, that’s my life.</p>
<p>l’m surrounded with furniture from that period. l can’t change myself any more.</p>
<p>But if l see today designers, they use all typefaces-one day one typeface,</p>
<p>the other day the other typeface, all in favor of a certain atmosphere,</p>
<p>l’m not … l don’t like that.</p>
<p>l’m always interested in clarity.</p>
<p>lt should be clear,</p>
<p>it should be readable, it should be straightforward.</p>
<p>So l started using, gradually, grids for my design,</p>
<p>for my catalogues for museums.</p>
<p>l invented a grid, and within the grid</p>
<p>l played my game.</p>
<p>But always along the lines of the grid,</p>
<p>so that there is a certain order in it.</p>
<p>That’s why l use grids,</p>
<p>that’s why they call me ”Gridnik.”</p>
<p>For me, it’s a tool of creating order,</p>
<p>and creating order is typography.</p>
<p>l started late with the computer.</p>
<p>l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first computer</p>
<p>and l learned myself and l can handle it now quite well</p>
<p>but not like the young people.</p>
<p>l am slow with it and l can do it.</p>
<p>But l’m very much interested and</p>
<p>l would have liked to have in the sixties the computer</p>
<p>because we can speed up our work, we can do it so much better,</p>
<p>and especially all the layers you can bring into your work.</p>
<p>We had the greatest problem in the sixties to bring two or three layers into the work.</p>
<p>You need to do it by photograph, you did all kinds of crazy techniques</p>
<p>and working on a poster took us days.</p>
<p>And now within half an hour you have your ideas and you can make variations</p>
<p>and make a good choice.</p>
<p>You can’t do better design with a computer,</p>
<p>but you can speed up your work enormously.</p>
<p>Shall l begin?</p>
<p>l made these post stamps on the Stijl movement.</p>
<p>ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,</p>
<p>l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,
one of the artists of the Stijl movement.</p>
<p>Then l decided for the final designs</p>
<p>not to use these typefaces because the
illustration is already from that period,</p>
<p>and l used the most neutral typeface-Helvetica.</p>
<p>Helvetica was a real step from the nineteenth-century typefaces.</p>
<p>lt was a little more machined,</p>
<p>it was doing away with these manual details in it,</p>
<p>and we were impressed by that, because it was more neutral.</p>
<p>And neutralism was a word that we loved.</p>
<p>lt should be neutral;</p>
<p>it shouldn’t have a meaning in itself. lt should …</p>
<p>the meaning is in the content of the text, not in the typeface.</p>
<p>That’s why we loved Helvetica very much.</p>
<p>l have to say that for a lot of my life</p>
<p>l rather dreaded the moment of having to explain to someone…</p>
<p>you know, you find yourself sitting next to some nice person on a plane</p>
<p>or a train and they ask you sooner or later what you do</p>
<p>and if you say type designer, they generally look completely blank.</p>
<p>Occasionally, someone will actually know the term</p>
<p>but then will say, ”l thought they were all dead.”</p>
<p>Since l did some work for Microsoft in the mid-nineties on screen fonts,</p>
<p>particularly Verdana and Georgia,</p>
<p>l’ve had quite comical encounters with people who will say,</p>
<p>”Oh, you work with fonts.</p>
<p>We just got this memo round the office
saying we’ve all got to start using something called Verdana.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of it?”</p>
<p>Funny conversations that never would have happened to me
thirty, forty years ago.</p>
<p>My dad was a typographer, and although he didn’t push me to follow in his footsteps</p>
<p>when l left school, high school in the UK, l
had a year to fill before going to university</p>
<p>and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid trainee, intern,</p>
<p>to a type foundry in the Netherlands,</p>
<p>where l spent a year learning what turned
out to be a completely obsolete trade</p>
<p>of making type by hand.</p>
<p>lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel, engraving them at actual size.</p>
<p>You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to one letter a day at that time.</p>
<p>So, you know, l could say that really l’ve made type by practically all the means</p>
<p>it’s ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one years that l’ve been working.</p>
<p>lt’s hard to generalize about the way type designers work.</p>
<p>There isn’t a generality of us.</p>
<p>But l think that most type designers if they were sitting in this chair</p>
<p>would essentially start in much the same way.</p>
<p>l’d probably start with a lowercase h.</p>
<p>it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans serif or a serif typeface.</p>
<p>lf it were a serif face it would look like this</p>
<p>here are the serifs so called, these little feet</p>
<p>on the bottom and top of the principal strokes of the letter.</p>
<p>Are they heavy, are they light, what is the nature of the serif,</p>
<p>is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the letter form;</p>
<p>what are the proportions of the overall height, the ascender, so-called of the h,</p>
<p>and the x-height part of it,</p>
<p>Then because an h is a straight-sided letter,</p>
<p>l would then do a round letter like an o along side it.</p>
<p>l can get a sense of how the weight of the curved part of the o
relates to the straight part of the h.</p>
<p>And already there is a huge amount of DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.</p>
<p>l’d then probably do something like a lowercase p</p>
<p>because it’s half straight and half round;</p>
<p>and also it has a descending stroke,</p>
<p>which is another vertical dimension that l
would be interested in establishing.</p>
<p>Then l would then build on that.</p>
<p>lf you’ve got an h you’ve got an awful lot of information</p>
<p>about m, n, and u in the lower case.</p>
<p>lf you’ve got a p you’ve got q and b and d and so on.</p>
<p>And then just as soon as possible l would get them into words</p>
<p>or something that looked like words</p>
<p>because for me the experience of reading
something is so critical in judging it as a typeface</p>
<p>because l find that is the acid test of how a typeface performs.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic and to my
mind beautiful things about Helvetica</p>
<p>is these horizontal terminals, you see in the lower case a and c and e and g.</p>
<p>The whole structure is based on this horizontal slicing off of the terminals.</p>
<p>It’s very hard for a designer to look at these characters and say,</p>
<p>how would l improve them? How would l make them any different?</p>
<p>They just seem to be exactly right.</p>
<p>l’m glad no one asked me to</p>
<p>second-guess Helvetica</p>
<p>because l wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>This is the original type specimen of Helvetica</p>
<p>before it was Helvetica. lt had its original name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.</p>
<p>The whole story of how Helvetica came into being</p>
<p>is not entirely clear, at least to me.</p>
<p>lt is said, and l think it’s true,</p>
<p>that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the boss at Haas type foundry,</p>
<p>wished to make a modernized version of Akzidenz Grotesk,</p>
<p>which was essentially a traditional nineteenth-century German sans serif,</p>
<p>and his method of doing that was sort of to clean it up and so on.</p>
<p>And it was of course Max Miedinger who made the drawings for Helvetica.</p>
<p>l received the impression from people l knew back in the sixties and seventies</p>
<p>that Hoffmann’s part in this was a very much more significant one</p>
<p>than you might just assume by reading in a textbook</p>
<p>that Max Miedinger was the designer of Helvetica.</p>
<p>You can easily say this was a joint product</p>
<p>of both Miedinger and my father.</p>
<p>Miedinger couldn’t produce a typeface alone;</p>
<p>neither could my father.</p>
<p>But when both were working hard together then something good resulted.</p>
<p>Here are the first trials of Neue Haas Grotesk,</p>
<p>which was the first name of Helvetica.</p>
<p>l knew the way things worked at Haas</p>
<p>and l had gradually picked up on the importance of Eduard Hoffman,</p>
<p>and his almost pathological shyness</p>
<p>and the way that he would use other people’s hands.</p>
<p>But boy could you see his mind at work on the faces</p>
<p>where he was deeply involved.</p>
<p>You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann</p>
<p>indicating all the desired corrections.</p>
<p>”The capital Y is too slim.</p>
<p>The capital A is also too slim.”</p>
<p>When you talk about the design of Haas Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,</p>
<p>what it’s all about is the interrelationship of the negative shape</p>
<p>the figure-ground relationship,</p>
<p>the shapes between characters and within characters,</p>
<p>with the black if you like, with the inked surface.</p>
<p>And the Swiss pay more attention to the background,</p>
<p>so that the counters and the space
between characters just hold the letters.</p>
<p>l mean you can’t imagine anything moving;</p>
<p>it is so firm.</p>
<p>lt’s not a letter that’s bent to shape;</p>
<p>it’s a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space.</p>
<p>lt’s … oh it’s brilliant when it’s done well.</p>
<p>My father had clear ideas</p>
<p>how the typeface should look.</p>
<p>So my father and Miedinger sat together,
and he started drawing.</p>
<p>Here you have a proof of an alphabet</p>
<p>with observations by Max Miedinger.</p>
<p>When Miedinger worked for Haas he did
not work as a designer.</p>
<p>He was actually a salesman.</p>
<p>His job was to travel around Switzerland</p>
<p>taking orders for fonts of type.</p>
<p>By profession he was a graphic artist,</p>
<p>but he realized that he could make more
money by selling foundry type.</p>
<p>But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of
a new typeface, l’m sure that you could design it.</p>
<p>l have here a type specimen book</p>
<p>of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.</p>
<p>You have to know that Haas was
controlled by the German type foundry Stempel.</p>
<p>And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype.</p>
<p>Now we go down to the cellar and see in
our archives where we can find Helvetica.</p>
<p>Here we have number 24.</p>
<p>And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.</p>
<p>The marketing director at Stempel had the
idea to give it a better name</p>
<p>because Neue Haas Grotesk didn’t sound very good for a</p>
<p>typeface that was intended to be sold in the United States.</p>
<p>Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.</p>
<p>This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin name of Switzerland.</p>
<p>My father said, That’s impossible.</p>
<p>You cannot call a typeface after the name of a country.</p>
<p>So he said, why don’t you call it Helvetica.</p>
<p>So in other words this would be the Swiss typeface.</p>
<p>And they agreed.</p>
<p>l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the time.</p>
<p>Swiss typography at that time also was well-known worldwide.</p>
<p>So it was the best solution for Helvetica</p>
<p>to get into the market.</p>
<p>Once we’d introduced Helvetica, it really ran away.</p>
<p>lt was exactly what the designers were looking for.</p>
<p>l mean, l don’t think there’s been such a hot thing since</p>
<p>as the figure-ground relationship properly executed</p>
<p>and it was… oh, just a landslide waiting to
go down the mountain.</p>
<p>And away it went.</p>
<p>l imagine there was a time when it just felt so good</p>
<p>to take something that was old and dusty
and homemade and crappy looking</p>
<p>and replace it with Helvetica.</p>
<p>lt just must have felt like you were scraping
the crud off of like filthy old things</p>
<p>and restoring them to shining beauty. And in fact</p>
<p>corporate identity in the sixties, that’s what
it sort of consisted of.</p>
<p>Clients would come in and they’d have
piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties</p>
<p>that hide like shapes on them and goofy bad photographs.</p>
<p>They’d have some letterhead that would
say Amalgamated Widget on the top</p>
<p>in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,
above Amalgamated Widget</p>
<p>it would have an engraving showing their headquarters</p>
<p>in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks belching smoke</p>
<p>you know, and then you go to a corporate
identity consultant circa 1965, 1966,</p>
<p>and they would take that and lay it here
and say, Here’s your current stationery,</p>
<p>and all it implies, and this is what we’re proposing.</p>
<p>And next to that, next to the belching smokestacks and</p>
<p>the nuptial script and the ivory paper,</p>
<p>they’d have a crisp bright white piece of paper</p>
<p>and instead of Amalgamated Widget, founded 1 857,</p>
<p>it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica Medium</p>
<p>Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling that was?</p>
<p>That must have seemed like you’d crawled through a desert</p>
<p>with your mouth just caked with filthy dust</p>
<p>and then someone is offering you a clear,
refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water</p>
<p>to clear away all this horrible, kind of like, burden of history.</p>
<p>lt must have been just fantastic. And you
know it must have been fantastic</p>
<p>because it was done over and over and over again.</p>
<p>So this is what l’m talking about, this is Life Magazine 1 953.</p>
<p>One ad after another in here, that just kind of shows every
single visual bad habit that was endemic in those days.</p>
<p>You’ve got zany hand lettering everywhere,</p>
<p>swash typography to signify elegance,</p>
<p>exclamation points, exclamation points,
exclamation points.</p>
<p>Cursive wedding invitation typography
down here reading,</p>
<p>”Almost everyone appreciates the best.”</p>
<p>This was everywhere in the Fifties, this is
how everything looked in the Fifties.</p>
<p>You cut to - this is after Helvetica was in
full swing - same product.</p>
<p>No people, no smiling fakery,</p>
<p>just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.</p>
<p>The slogan underneath: lt’s the Real Thing,</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>Coke, period.</p>
<p>ln Helvetica, period.</p>
<p>Any questions? Of course not. Drink Coke, period.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Governments and corporations love Helvetica</p>
<p>because on one hand it makes them seem neutral and efficient,</p>
<p>but also the smoothness of the letters
makes them seem almost human.</p>
<p>That is a quality they all want to convey</p>
<p>because of course they have the image they are always fighting</p>
<p>that they are authoritarian they’re bureaucratic,</p>
<p>you lose yourself in them, they’re oppressive.</p>
<p>So instead, by using Helvetica</p>
<p>they can come off seeming more
accessible, transparent, and accountable,</p>
<p>which are all the buzzwords for what corporations</p>
<p>and governments are supposed to be today.</p>
<p>Now they don’t have to be accessible or
accountable or transparent</p>
<p>but they can look that way.</p>
<p>Our tax forms from the lRS are in Helvetica.</p>
<p>The EPA uses it</p>
<p>now there’s someone who wants to look
clean and official and efficient.</p>
<p>Designers, and l think even readers, invest
so much of the surroundings in the typeface.</p>
<p>American Apparel uses Helvetica and it looks cheeky.</p>
<p>American Airlines uses it and it looks sober.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a matter of the weight they
use and the letter spacing and the colors.</p>
<p>There’s something about the typeface l think
really invites this sort of open interpretation.</p>
<p>l suppose you could say the typefaces are either</p>
<p>those that are fully open to interpretation</p>
<p>or merely have one association attached to them.</p>
<p>A typeface made of icicles or candy canes
or something just says one thing.</p>
<p>And Helvetica maybe says everything.</p>
<p>And that’s perhaps part of its appeal.</p>
<p>Typography has this real poverty of terms to describe things.</p>
<p>Beyond x height and cap height and weight and so on.</p>
<p>I find when Tobias and I work on projects together</p>
<p>we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms that are entirely subjective.</p>
<p>Working on the typeface for Esquire years ago, I remember us saying,</p>
<p>I remember my saying, No this has that Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.</p>
<p>lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti
typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso feeling.</p>
<p>I know you got exactly what I was saying. -I did. -</p>
<p>But it’s that there’s really no way to describe the qualitative parts
of a typeface without resorting to things are fully outside it.</p>
<p>And we’re constantly saying, You know,
this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;</p>
<p>it needs to be Debussy.</p>
<p>Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders look.</p>
<p>lt needs to be, you know, much more elegant… hand-lasted shoe.</p>
<p>l’ve been collecting these signs for a couple of years now</p>
<p>and one of my favorites is these signs. l have a number of these.</p>
<p>This is what the street signs in New York City used to look like.</p>
<p>This actually functions so much more clearly</p>
<p>and so much more effectively than what we
see out on the street now.</p>
<p>The sort of classical modernist line on</p>
<p>how aware a reader should be of a typeface</p>
<p>is that they shouldn’t be aware of it at all.</p>
<p>lt should be this crystal goblet</p>
<p>there to just hold and display and organize</p>
<p>the information. But I don’t think it’s really quite as simple as that.</p>
<p>I think even if they’re not consciously</p>
<p>aware of the typeface they’re reading,
they’ll certainly be affected by it.</p>
<p>The same way that an actor that’s miscast
in a role will affect someone’s experience</p>
<p>of a movie or play that they’re watching.
They’ll still follow the plot,</p>
<p>but, you know, be less convinced or excited or affected.</p>
<p>I think that typography is similar to that,</p>
<p>where the designer choosing typefaces is
essentially a casting director.</p>
<p>There’s very little type in my world outside of work.</p>
<p>Like everybody else I’m aware of fonts
being used in my environment.</p>
<p>You know, the standing joke that graphic
designers can’t see historical movies</p>
<p>because the fonts are always wrong is certainly true.</p>
<p>lt definitely makes the world outside the office very different.</p>
<p>in our neighborhood, and she remembered it as that new place</p>
<p>that’s just a couple blocks down from the dry cleaner.</p>
<p>I remembered it as that new place just a couple blocks down from</p>
<p>the place with the bad letter spacing out front.</p>
<p>Nobody doesn’t know what Helvetica is,</p>
<p>I mean, at the beginning of our careers
certainly before anybody had a PC or a Mac,</p>
<p>no one knew what fonts were.</p>
<p>I think even then people might have known what Helvetica was.</p>
<p>The fact that it’s been so heavily licensed</p>
<p>and made available through these very populist technologies</p>
<p>has kind of furthered the mythology that it’s
the ultimate typeface in some way.</p>
<p>And even for us professionals that’s hard to escape from.</p>
<p>I kind of find myself buying into the idea</p>
<p>that ”Oh, the sans serif evolved for a hundred years</p>
<p>and the ultimate expression was Helvetica.”</p>
<p>And realizing, wait a minute that’s not quite true, historically</p>
<p>or aesthetically or culturally or politically.</p>
<p>But there’s something about it that does have the feeling of finality to it,</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of one line of reasoning with this typeface,</p>
<p>and perhaps everything after it is secondary in some way.</p>
<p>I’m obviously a typomaniac, which is an incurable, if not mortal, disease.</p>
<p>I can’t explain it I just love, I just like looking at type,</p>
<p>I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends.</p>
<p>Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls’ bottoms,</p>
<p>I get kicks out of looking at type.</p>
<p>lt’s a little worrying I must admit, it’s a very nerdish thing to do.</p>
<p>I’m very much a word person.</p>
<p>So that’s why typography for me is the obvious extension.</p>
<p>lt just makes my words visible.</p>
<p>A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast; it comes from handwriting.</p>
<p>That’s why I can read your handwriting, and you can read mine.</p>
<p>And I’m sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica</p>
<p>or anything that would be considered legible.</p>
<p>But we can read it because there’s a rhythm to it, there’s a contrast to it.</p>
<p>Helvetica hasn’t got any of that.</p>
<p>|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|</p>
<p>I don’t know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?</p>
<p>No, actually, Helvetica was a good typeface at the time.</p>
<p>lt really answered a demand.</p>
<p>But now it’s become one of those defaults that,</p>
<p>partly because of the proliferation of the
computer, which is now twenty years,</p>
<p>the PC I mean,</p>
<p>it was the default on the Apple Macintosh
and then it became the default on Windows</p>
<p>which copied everything that Apple did, as you know.</p>
<p>lnterface and everything else, and then they did the clone version, Arial,</p>
<p>which is worse than Helvetica but</p>
<p>fills the same purpose I think. Now it’s probably never going to go away</p>
<p>because it’s ubiquitous; it’s a default. lt’s air,</p>
<p>you know, it’s just there. There’s no choice.</p>
<p>You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica.</p>
<p>lt brings style with it; every typeface does.</p>
<p>lt has a certain,</p>
<p>well, it’s like a person, if you are slightly heavy in the middle</p>
<p>you’re not going to walk around in tight T-shirts. You’d look like an idiot.</p>
<p>And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it has a certain,</p>
<p>it needs certain space around it, needs a lot of white space;</p>
<p>it needs very carefully to be looked at the weight gradations.</p>
<p>lt needs a lot of space sideways also.</p>
<p>Then it’s very legible, but</p>
<p>very small and very tightly done and very lightly as modern designers do,</p>
<p>it’s a nightmare, a total nightmare.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say this if I hadn’t tried it.</p>
<p>Because all the letters … it’s the whole Swiss ideology;</p>
<p>the guy who designed it tried to make all the letters look the same.</p>
<p>Hello??? You know, that’s called an army. That’s not people.</p>
<p>That’s people having the same fucking helmet on.</p>
<p>lt doesn’t further individualism.</p>
<p>And the aim with type design always is to make it individual enough</p>
<p>so that it’s interesting,</p>
<p>but of course ninety-five percent of any
alphabet has to look like the other alphabet</p>
<p>otherwise you wouldn’t be able to read it.</p>
<p>l’ve never sort of woken up with a typeface coming out,</p>
<p>you know, like some people … l’ve got to do this, and they go to their,</p>
<p>whatever, their easel, and these amazing brush strokes.</p>
<p>I don’t have that urge.</p>
<p>You know, I wake up and usually I want to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody puts their history into their work.</p>
<p>I certainly know that when I draw something it has</p>
<p>I’m fast, I’m loud, I’m chaotic,</p>
<p>I’m not very rule based, even though I’m German and I love rules,</p>
<p>I’m a Gemini, I had my birthday yesterday, so I’m all over the place essentially.</p>
<p>I’m always on time, but a year late, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>but then I’m on the second.</p>
<p>So I have this horrible thing, which comes out in my typefaces.</p>
<p>They’re never perfect. They always have a little edge</p>
<p>in the sense that I leave them alone when l get bored with them.</p>
<p>I know there’s people who hate me, who
would never use one of my typefaces in a million years</p>
<p>and vice versa, people who would use any typeface I design</p>
<p>not because it’s good for them or it fits the purpose,</p>
<p>simply because I did it.</p>
<p>I think we alI do that. Certain bands I buy every CD from them;</p>
<p>some of them are crap.</p>
<p>But I buy it because l’ve always bought their CDs</p>
<p>lch habe sie immer gekauft,</p>
<p>or their music.</p>
<p>Why do people buy certain things? The brand rubs off on them.</p>
<p>And typefaces are a brand.</p>
<p>You’re telling an audience, This is for you,
by using a certain typographic voice.</p>
<p>You’d recognize a Marlboro brand two miles away</p>
<p>because they use a typeface that they only use</p>
<p>You can buy it; I have it; anyone can, it’s called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,</p>
<p>but Marlboro have made the typeface theirs.</p>
<p>You can recognize any Marlboro ad from miles away</p>
<p>because of that stupid typeface.</p>
<p>lf they’d used Helvetica… Hello??? lt wouldn’t quite work.</p>
<p>The way something is presented will define the way you react to it.</p>
<p>So you can take the same message and present it in three different typefaces,</p>
<p>and the response to that, the immediate emotional response will be different.</p>
<p>And the choice of typeface is the prime weapon,</p>
<p>if you want, in that communication.</p>
<p>And I say weapon largely because with
commercial marketing and advertising,</p>
<p>the way a message is dressed is going to
define our reaction to that message in the advertising.</p>
<p>So if it says, buy these jeans, and it’s a grunge font,</p>
<p>you would expect it to be some kind of ripped jeans</p>
<p>or to be sold in some kind of underground clothing store.</p>
<p>lf you see that same message in Helvetica,</p>
<p>you know, it’s probably on sale at Gap.</p>
<p>You know it’s going to be clean, that you’re
going to fit in, you’re not going to stand out.</p>
<p>All of us, I would suggest, are prompted in subliminal ways.</p>
<p>Maybe the feeling you have when you see a particular
typographic choices used on a piece of packaging,</p>
<p>is just, I like the look of that, that feels good, that’s my kind of product.</p>
<p>But that’s the type casting its secret spell.</p>
<p>ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt’s a mark of membership;</p>
<p>it’s a badge that says we’re part of modern society,</p>
<p>we share the same ideals.</p>
<p>lt’s well-rounded, it’s not going to be damaging or dangerous.</p>
<p>Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance of push and pull in its letters,</p>
<p>and that perfect balance sort of is saying to us,</p>
<p>well not sort of, it is saying to us,</p>
<p>Don’t worry, any of the problems you’re having, or problems in the world,</p>
<p>538
00:42:26,010 —> 00:42:28,979
or problems getting through the subway or finding a bathroom,</p>
<p>all those problems aren’t going to spill over, they’ll be contained,</p>
<p>and in fact maybe they don’t exist.</p>
<p>What I like is if this very serious typeface</p>
<p>tells you the do’s and don’ts of street life,</p>
<p>and it must be Helvetica at that moment.</p>
<p>The image of Helvetica as the corporate typeface</p>
<p>made it the so-called typeface of capitalism,</p>
<p>which I would actually reject and say</p>
<p>it’s the typeface of socialism</p>
<p>because it is available all over and it’s
inviting dilettantes and amateurs and</p>
<p>everybody to do typography,</p>
<p>to create their own type designs, and l think that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>And I think I’m right calling Helvetica the perfume of the city.</p>
<p>lt’s just something we don’t notice usually</p>
<p>but we would miss very much if it wouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>I think it’s quite amazing that a typeface can advance to such a status</p>
<p>in our lives</p>
<p>As is always the case with any style, there’s a law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The more you see it, the more the public sees it,</p>
<p>the more the designer uses those typographic and graphic solutions,</p>
<p>the more familiar, predictable, and ultimately dull they become.</p>
<p>By the time I started as a designer, it sort
of seemed there was only one trick in town,</p>
<p>which was like, what can you use instead of Helvetica.</p>
<p>You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.</p>
<p>And you do need lot of sans serif typefaces,</p>
<p>but it seemed like Helvetica had just been used so much and overused so much</p>
<p>and associated with so many big, faceless things</p>
<p>that it had lost all its capacity even, to my eyes at least, to look nice.</p>
<p>And by the seventies, especially in America,</p>
<p>you start to get a reaction against,</p>
<p>what it seems to those designers is the conformity,</p>
<p>the kind of dull blanket of sameness</p>
<p>that this way of designing is imposing on the world.</p>
<p>So something that had come out of idealism</p>
<p>has by this time become merely routine, and there’s a need for a change.</p>
<p>You come into design,</p>
<p>at the point that you start out in history,</p>
<p>without knowing that you’re starting out in history,</p>
<p>and often you don’t have a sense of what came before you and how it got there,</p>
<p>and you certainly don’t know what’s going to come after.</p>
<p>And when I walked into design as a student at Tyler School of Art,</p>
<p>what struck me was sort of two separate cultures of design.</p>
<p>One was the corporate culture,</p>
<p>and the corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations,</p>
<p>and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica.</p>
<p>They looked alike, they looked a little fascistic to me.</p>
<p>They were clean, it reminded me of cleaning up your room.</p>
<p>I felt like, this was some conspiracy of my
mother’s, to make me keep the house clean,</p>
<p>that all my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me</p>
<p>in the form of Helvetica, and I had to overthrow it.</p>
<p>Hey, I got some printouts of the stuff from last night.</p>
<p>I also was morally opposed to Helvetica,</p>
<p>because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica</p>
<p>as sponsors of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>So therefore, if you used Helvetica,</p>
<p>it meant that you were in favor of the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>so how could you use it?</p>
<p>What looked cool to me at that point were
record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling papers,</p>
<p>the accoutrements of dope life and counterculture,</p>
<p>obviously underground newspapers and magazines, and Pushpin Studios.</p>
<p>Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the time I was in college,</p>
<p>everybody’s ambition. To work there, to do
work that was as inspiring as their work,</p>
<p>because it seemed fresh and alive and witty and content-laden,</p>
<p>aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast and Milton Glazer could really draw.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make work that looked like that.</p>
<p>When I was at Tyler, I wanted to be an illustrator,</p>
<p>and I had a teacher named Stanislaw Zagorski.</p>
<p>And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs.</p>
<p>We would make book covers and record covers as school projects,</p>
<p>and l’d go to the local art store, l’d go to
Sam Flax, and l’d buy Helvetica as press type,</p>
<p>and l’d rub it down in the corner of the album
the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left.</p>
<p>And of course it would never line up
properly and thing would crackle and break</p>
<p>and it’d be terrible.</p>
<p>And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type,</p>
<p>and illustrate the type.</p>
<p>And it hadn’t dawned on me that typography could have personality</p>
<p>the way drawing did.</p>
<p>I realized that type had spirit and could convey mood,</p>
<p>and that it could be your own medium,</p>
<p>that it was its own palate, a broad palate to express all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I painted this cover the AlGA Annual,</p>
<p>and the title of the AlGA Annual was
Graphic Design U.S.A.</p>
<p>And I decided I would take the title literally</p>
<p>and sort of analyze what Graphic Design U.S.A. was,</p>
<p>so I decided what l’d do is list every state in the United States,</p>
<p>and the percentage of people who used Helvetica.</p>
<p>And I didn’t have any scientific evidence of knowing
what percentage of people in each state used Helvetica,</p>
<p>so I decided to base it on the last Reagan election.</p>
<p>So that the states that went for Reagan</p>
<p>all had more than 50% of the people who used Helvetica.</p>
<p>| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>what’s the typeface of this war? |</p>
<p>The lraqi War?</p>
<p>Helvetica.</p>
<p>Same time period, I mean it is, it’s the same, it repeated.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re there. Helvetica caused it.</p>
<p>And so ln the Postmodern period, designers were breaking things up.</p>
<p>They wanted to get away from the orderly, clean, smooth surface of design</p>
<p>the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it</p>
<p>and produce something that had vitality.</p>
<p>I myself got fairly disappointed</p>
<p>with Modernism in general.</p>
<p>lt simply became boring.</p>
<p>lf I see a brochure now, with lots of white space</p>
<p>that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the top</p>
<p>and a little abstract logo on the bottom</p>
<p>and a picture of a businessman walking somewhere,</p>
<p>the overall communication that says to me is,</p>
<p>Do Not Read Me, because I will bore the shit out of you</p>
<p>not just visually, but also in content</p>
<p>because the content will likely say the same as it says to me visually.</p>
<p>I was in terrible rock bands when I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,</p>
<p>and I think through that experience got close to the album cover</p>
<p>and essentially I went to art school because of album covers.</p>
<p>I probably was the last generation who got taught doing everything by hand,</p>
<p>so you know, we drew 10 pt. type with a brush.</p>
<p>ln general, I was always fairly bored, you know, looking at type books</p>
<p>and deciding over and over again which type to pick for a certain project.</p>
<p>lt just didn’t seem a very interesting task to do.</p>
<p>So here and there I think with the records, with the CD covers,</p>
<p>we started to do our own type</p>
<p>and I think there was one instance, it was
for a Lou Reed cover,</p>
<p>where this hand drawn typography resonated,</p>
<p>and numerous projects came out in that vein, in all sorts of directions.</p>
<p>You know, in a more funny direction and in a more serious direction,</p>
<p>where one time an intern carved a hand type into my skin for a lecture poster.</p>
<p>The type in an instant, in a single image,</p>
<p>tells the story of its making, tells you about its process,</p>
<p>in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.</p>
<p>That typography strangely became so well
known, just within the design community</p>
<p>of course, that some people thought that’s all we do,</p>
<p>which thankfully is not the case.</p>
<p>Well, I always thought that approach of people
using only three or four typefaces very suspect.</p>
<p>I think this could be interesting to do for a single project</p>
<p>as an exercise to put up additional limitations in order to focus yourself.</p>
<p>But as a strategy over a lifetime</p>
<p>I think it’s akin to a writer saying,</p>
<p>I’m only going to write in three or four words.</p>
<p>Yes, you could probably do it, but for one why would you,</p>
<p>and for the second would it really yield an
interesting body of work over a lifetime?</p>
<p>Designers wanted to express their subjectivity,</p>
<p>their own feelings about the world,</p>
<p>their sense that they had something to say through design,</p>
<p>through the design choices they made.</p>
<p>And of course this caused controversy.</p>
<p>lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,
who’d been one of the Sixties’ high priests,</p>
<p>with his company Unimark,</p>
<p>it’s right there in the name, Unimark, the idea of a uniform kind of expression.</p>
<p>When he looked at this new work,</p>
<p>this expressive, subjective, wayward,</p>
<p>to his way of thinking irrational new way of designing,</p>
<p>lt seemed like the barbarians were not only at the gate,</p>
<p>but they’d stormed through and they’d taken over.</p>
<p>ln the ’70s, the young generation was after psychedelic type,</p>
<p>and all the junk that you could find.</p>
<p>And also in the ’80s, with their minds completely confused</p>
<p>by that… disease that was called Postmodernism,</p>
<p>people were just going around like
chickens without their heads,</p>
<p>by using all kinds of typefaces that came around that could say ”not modern”.</p>
<p>They didn’t know what they were caring for,</p>
<p>they only knew about what they were against.</p>
<p>And what they were against was Helvetica.</p>
<p>I had no formal training in the field,</p>
<p>ln my case I never learned all the things l wasn’t supposed to do.</p>
<p>I just did what made sense to me.</p>
<p>I was just experimenting really.</p>
<p>So when people started getting really upset, I didn’t really understand why.</p>
<p>l’d say, ”What’s the big deal? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>And it was many years later that somebody explained to me,</p>
<p>probably better than I can explain it now,</p>
<p>is that basically there was this group that
spent a lot of time trying to organize things,</p>
<p>and get some kind of system going,</p>
<p>and they saw me as coming in and throwing that out the window.</p>
<p>Which I might have done, but it wasn’t the starting point</p>
<p>and it wasn’t the plan.</p>
<p>Only much later did I learn the terms Modernism, and this and that.</p>
<p>Raygun Magazine was very much experimental,</p>
<p>it was completely experimental. Every issue we’d try a lot of things</p>
<p>and a lot of them worked,</p>
<p>and a lot of them didn’t work.</p>
<p>I never saw proofs so a lot of times there were just mistakes,</p>
<p>flat-out mistakes, that people would write long essays on</p>
<p>why I did this black type on a black boot, or something.</p>
<p>No, I never saw a proof, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>lt’s very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well.</p>
<p>You know, I can teach anybody off the street</p>
<p>how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter.</p>
<p>But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD</p>
<p>and say, ”Okay, now let’s interpret that music for a cover,</p>
<p>well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost</p>
<p>and are going to do something corny and expected,</p>
<p>and one person is going to do something amazing</p>
<p>because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction</p>
<p>that nobody else could go. And that’s the
area to me where it gets more interesting</p>
<p>and exciting, and more emotional.</p>
<p>And that’s where the best work comes from.</p>
<p>This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,</p>
<p>and when I read the article it was very
much like so many of these others I had read,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh man, how disappointing, how boring.</p>
<p>And I went through all my fonts, which at
the time would’ve been hundreds and hundreds,</p>
<p>uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and</p>
<p>didn’t find one that seemed to fit my disgust and boredom with this article.</p>
<p>And I finally came to the bottom and there was Dingbats,</p>
<p>which of course now it’s Zapf Dingbats so it’s literally the last one.</p>
<p>And I was like, well it’s boring and not worth reading,</p>
<p>why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?</p>
<p>lt’s a font. So it’s all set in Dingbats,</p>
<p>it is the actual font, you could highlight it
and make it Helvetica or something</p>
<p>and you’d be able to read it</p>
<p>but it really wouldn’t be worthwhile, it’s not very well-written.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse legibility with communication.</p>
<p>Just because something’s legible, doesn’t mean it communicates</p>
<p>And more importantly doesn’t mean it communicates the right thing.</p>
<p>And vice-versa, something that may be difficult to initially read</p>
<p>could be sending a completely different message</p>
<p>that is valid for where it’s being used,</p>
<p>and that may require a little more time or the involvement of the reader.</p>
<p>But it almost seems stronger the other way,</p>
<p>if something is a very important message
and it’s set in a boring, non-descript way,</p>
<p>the message can be lost.</p>
<p>I mean that doesn’t say ”caffeinated”!</p>
<p>It’s just like, hello?</p>
<p>|Why Not?|</p>
<p>It’s just sitting there! There’s nothing caffeinated about it!</p>
<p>There’s nothing ”extramarital” about that.</p>
<p>There’s no ”sunshine” here.</p>
<p>That’s no fun, that’s not a fun sandlot.</p>
<p>Where’s the explosion?</p>
<p>This could be the first date.</p>
<p>This might be close, these buses are kind of boring.</p>
<p>There’s a very thin line between simple and clean and powerful,
and simple and clean and boring.</p>
<p>That was sort of the rise of what’s referred to as grunge typography,</p>
<p>and that became an all-consuming aesthetic for two, three, four, five years</p>
<p>as that trend worked its way down from the masters who originated it</p>
<p>to anyone who sort of already had a tendency to make mistakes</p>
<p>and all of sudden found that they looked good now instead of incompetent,</p>
<p>which is how they looked the day before.</p>
<p>Typography was so broken by the end of the grunge period,</p>
<p>just lying there in a twisted heap,</p>
<p>all rules cast aside, no apparent way forward,</p>
<p>that all those designers could perhaps do by the late nineties was to go back</p>
<p>to return to an earlier way of designing,</p>
<p>but with a new set of theories to support it.</p>
<p>For us, modernism does have a more subversive side.</p>
<p>I think that the whole image of modernism</p>
<p>as something that is primarily concerned with functionalism,</p>
<p>utilitarianism, that is something that emerged much later,</p>
<p>that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.</p>
<p>I think the early-modernist movements,</p>
<p>like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,</p>
<p>all had their more subversive sides</p>
<p>and their more, how do you call it,</p>
<p>dialectical sides, so they went against something.</p>
<p>It’s not that we are against that experimentation</p>
<p>that people like David Carson and Emigre and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.</p>
<p>We think what we do is a sort of an extension of that.</p>
<p>All that hunting to the next typeface every time, it took a lot of energy,</p>
<p>and I can still remember as students that we were really disappointed</p>
<p>because you wanted to use a certain
typeface and then you saw somebody else had used it,</p>
<p>and then you couldn’t use it because you wanted to be original.</p>
<p>And with Helvetica this whole problem is
non-existent because everybody’s using Helvetica.</p>
<p>A lot of people see the way a young generation of
designers uses a typeface such as Helvetica</p>
<p>as a more superficial way, as a sort of appropriation of a style.</p>
<p>I think we would very much disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think all three of us grew up in the ’70s</p>
<p>in the Netherlands which was dominated by the last moment of late Modernism.</p>
<p>For example, the city I was born in and grew up in, Rotterdam,</p>
<p>the logotype was designed by Wim Crouwel,</p>
<p>the stamps were designed by Crouwel,</p>
<p>the telephone book was designed by Crouwel,</p>
<p>the atlas that we used in school was designed by Crouwel.</p>
<p>So for us it is almost like a natural mother tongue,</p>
<p>that’s something really natural.</p>
<p>It’s not that we … I mean, a lot of people think you sort of study it</p>
<p>from books and then copy it or something, but</p>
<p>I would really say that it’s almost in our blood.</p>
<p>It’s also funny because a lot of people connect Helvetica</p>
<p>sometimes with the dangers of globalization and standardization.</p>
<p>I’m not afraid for that quality at all</p>
<p>because I’m just know that everybody can put a twist on it.</p>
<p>I think you can put as much nationality
in the spacing of a typeface as in the typeface itself.</p>
<p>And I think the way people like Crouwel
use Helvetica is typically Dutch, I think,</p>
<p>and that’s why I’m never really impressed with the argument</p>
<p>that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.</p>
<p>I’m not one of those people who is a real typographer,</p>
<p>I don’t know all the fancy words for all the letters,</p>
<p>and the sort of ligatures and ascenders
and descenders and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I just more, sort of, react to certain things,</p>
<p>and just do what I feel is right,</p>
<p>so I’m never sort of a classical type guy.</p>
<p>So I get obsessed about things, I collect things,</p>
<p>you know, I’ve got so many bits and scraps
of paper, of things that you find on the street,</p>
<p>or wrappers. It’s just making something
beautiful out of something very ordinary.</p>
<p>That’s what I really enjoy, the ordinary things</p>
<p>that most people would just gloss over, I find really beautiful.</p>
<p>The biggest thing for me in terms of design</p>
<p>is to get a sort of emotional response from a piece.</p>
<p>That’s some of the best design, I think.</p>
<p>I see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,</p>
<p>I wish I’d done that, that for me is the biggest thing, you know.</p>
<p>Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like, oooh, that’s nice.</p>
<p>It’s all about that emotional response.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve always really wanted to design is airplane signage,</p>
<p>an identity for an airline.</p>
<p>I’d love to do the uniforms, or you know,
seats and the whole thing, the trucks and</p>
<p>that kind of thing. I think it would be brilliant.</p>
<p>You know, I’ve done these twelve-inch sleeves for so long;</p>
<p>I want to go a little bit bigger scale now.</p>
<p>It’s that idea that something’s designed to stand the test of time,</p>
<p>and hopefully some of the things I’m
designing will be still being used in twenty, thirty years.</p>
<p>I’d love to think that.</p>
<p>I got married about three years ago. I did the wedding invites,</p>
<p>which believe me, is just the worst job you can ever do as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>I’ve done other people’s wedding invites, and I’ll never do one again.</p>
<p>It’s the most stressful job I’ve ever had,</p>
<p>dealing with mother in laws is just horrific. But I did ours,</p>
<p>and on the order of service</p>
<p>I did a little credit to give thanks to Max Miedinger for Helvetica.</p>
<p>But my wife vetoed that; I had to take it off the invite.</p>
<p>But it was funny …</p>
<p>I think I fell into the step of Helvetica when I was at DR.</p>
<p>I always really enjoy using Helvetica</p>
<p>because . . .some people say they use a
different typeface because it gives a different feeling.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy the challenge of making Helvetica speak in different ways.</p>
<p>It’s been around for fifty years, coming up,</p>
<p>and it’s just as fresh as it was … obviously,
it wasn’t intended to be this cool thing,</p>
<p>but it’s just a beautiful font.</p>
<p>Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica</p>
<p>than we used to be.</p>
<p>Yes, we were really obsessed with Helvetica, yet not more so much.</p>
<p>We accepted it somehow … We came to a
point where we accepted that it’s just there.</p>
<p>We like restrictions.</p>
<p>We can’t operate, we can do nothing without restrictions.</p>
<p>The more restrictions we have, the more，happy we are.</p>
<p>When we started school,</p>
<p>the influences in graphic design were like Brody and Carson.</p>
<p>It’s only after that we really looked at Josef</p>
<p>work, and ’60s Swiss Typography.</p>
<p>When we started the office we really said</p>
<p>we wanted to look back,</p>
<p>to find more structured design.</p>
<p>For us it’s very important to reduce the elements we use.</p>
<p>When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface,</p>
<p>or two, and if possible we will use one size.</p>
<p>We don’t like humanistic typefaces for example,</p>
<p>it must be more rational</p>
<p>because otherwise it has too much expression.</p>
<p>We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.</p>
<p>It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also</p>
<p>one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica</p>
<p>that in itself it is already</p>
<p>it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic</p>
<p>that you will just use it like that,</p>
<p>because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.</p>
<p>You wilI do what the typeface wants you to do.</p>
<p>If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer,</p>
<p>just use Helvetica Bold in one size,</p>
<p>like for a flyer… it looks good.</p>
<p>So it may very well be that when it comes to trends,</p>
<p>at least in graphic design, we’ve reached sort of the end of history.</p>
<p>The pendulum that swings back and forth
doesn’t have any more directions it can swing in.</p>
<p>The final trend may simply be the completely
democratic distribution of the means of production</p>
<p>to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.</p>
<p>You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks,</p>
<p>you can have a film studio for ten grand,</p>
<p>you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars,</p>
<p>and have basically</p>
<p>similar tools as the people who do this for a living.</p>
<p>If all these people have the tools to make good design,</p>
<p>they realize that it ain’t that easy.</p>
<p>It’s not just opening a template in CorelDraw or in Powerpoint.</p>
<p>It’s not about having the latest version of whatever program.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the eye, if you don’t a sense of design,</p>
<p>the program’s not going to give it to you.</p>
<p>I remember, years ago, a friend of mine
who produced radio commercials</p>
<p>had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records</p>
<p>and sing the beginning of ”Round Round Get Around, I Get Around”</p>
<p>by the Beach Boys.</p>
<p>And they really tried, they rehearsed for a
week to get their harmonies right,</p>
<p>and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor,</p>
<p>and they loved music.</p>
<p>And they went out and they sang it,</p>
<p>and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly…</p>
<p>terrible. But they’d rehearsed. And then</p>
<p>the voiceover for the commercial said,
”Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.”</p>
<p>And it’s really sort of the same thing.</p>
<p>The closer you come to it, and the more you see it,</p>
<p>the more you appreciate it when it’s terrific.</p>
<p>There are more good, young type designers</p>
<p>now, by young I mean probably late
twenties, early thirties, than at any time in history.</p>
<p>So who knows what typefaces they will design</p>
<p>in terms of style and so on. But they’ll be good.</p>
<p>And to my way of thinking, that is a huge gain,</p>
<p>a huge benefit that comes with this more
democratic, more accessible technology.</p>
<p>There’s just something about Helvetica.</p>
<p>Something about the fact that people keep
saying I’ve come up with an improvement of Helvetica.</p>
<p>And it never is really good.</p>
<p>You know, I wonder whether or not somehow there’s
some whole undiscovered science of typography</p>
<p>that would sort of say it’s not just because we’re used to seeing it,</p>
<p>it’s not just because it was associated with all these things</p>
<p>that we consider authoritative,</p>
<p>but it somehow has this kind of inherent rightness.</p>
<p>You know, the rightness of the way the lowercase a meets the curve,</p>
<p>the rightness of the way the G has the thing that comes down,</p>
<p>the rightness of the way the c strokes are like that instead of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn’t have believed that those
things actually could be right or wrong</p>
<p>as opposed to someone’s tastes.</p>
<p>Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of
history of the thing just sitting there</p>
<p>daring people to fix it. And it seems to be unfixable.</p>
<p>It’s always changing, time is changing,</p>
<p>the appreciation of typefaces is changing very much.</p>
<p>Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job</p>
<p>has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job.</p>
<p>You are always child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.</p>
<p>What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication</p>
<p>and graphic design, if we still want to call it that,</p>
<p>is accepted by many more people.</p>
<p>They get it. They understand it. They’re starting to see graphic communication</p>
<p>as an expression of their own identity.</p>
<p>And the classic case of this is the social networking programs</p>
<p>such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile.</p>
<p>You can change the background, you can put pictures in,</p>
<p>you can change the typeface to anything you want,</p>
<p>and those choices, those decisions you make,</p>
<p>become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way</p>
<p>you care about the clothing you’re wearing as an expression of who you are,</p>
<p>or your haircut or whatever,</p>
<p>or how you decorate your apartment-all of those things.</p>
<p>You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way,</p>
<p>through these consumer choices.</p>
<p>Well, now it’s happening in the sphere of visual communication</p>
<p>and there’s no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated,</p>
<p>why this just won’t go on developing, devoloping and developing.</p> </article>  </div> </main> <aside class="hidden lg:block sticky top-0 h-screen w-64 flex-shrink-0 py-8 pl-8"> <div
