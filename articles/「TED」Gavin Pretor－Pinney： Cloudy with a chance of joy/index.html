All right?<br>And you look up and what do you see?<br>Right? Or maybe the opposite.<br>You've just been dumped by your partner,<br>and everywhere you look, it's kissing couples.<br>(Laughter)<br>Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.<br>You know, you're thinking about your own mortality.<br>And there, on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.<br>(Laughter)<br>Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.<br>(Laughter)<br>What would that mean?<br>What would that mean? I have no idea.<br>But one thing I do know is this:<br>The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.<br>I think we should stand up for them,<br>which is why, a few years ago,<br>I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.<br>Tens of thousands of members now<br>in almost 100 countries around the world.<br>And all these photographs that I'm showing,<br>they were sent in by members.<br>And the society exists to remind people of this:<br>Clouds are not something to moan about.<br>Far from it. They are, in fact,<br>the most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.<br>I think, if you live with your head in the clouds<br>every now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.<br>And I want to show you why, with the help of<br>some of my favorite types of clouds.<br>Let's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud,<br>named after the Latin for a lock of hair.<br>It's composed entirely of ice crystals<br>cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere,<br>and as these ice crystals fall,<br>they pass through different layers with different winds<br>and they speed up and slow down,<br>giving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances,<br>these brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.<br>And these winds up there can be very, very fierce.<br>They can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.<br>These clouds are bombing along,<br>but from all the way down here,<br>they appear to be moving gracefully, slowly,<br>like most clouds.<br>And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down,<br>to calm down.<br>It's like a bit of everyday meditation.<br>Those are common clouds.<br>What about rarer ones, like the lenticularis,<br>the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?<br>These clouds form in the region of mountains.<br>When the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain,<br>it can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak,<br>with these clouds hovering at the crest<br>of these invisible standing waves of air,<br>these flying saucer-like forms,<br>and some of the early black-and-white UFO photos<br>are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.<br>A little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right?<br>This is when a layer is made up of very, very cold<br>water droplets, and in one region they start to freeze,<br>and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards<br>with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below,<br>giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.<br>Rarer still, the Kelvin-Helmholtz cloud.<br>Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.<br>This looks like a series of breaking waves,<br>and it's caused by shearing winds -- the wind<br>above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer<br>differ significantly, and in the middle, in between,<br>you get this undulating of the air,<br>and if the difference in those speeds is just right,<br>the tops of the undulations curl over<br>in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.<br>All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus,<br>but they're not that rare.<br>If you look up, and you pay attention to the sky,<br>you'll see them sooner or later,<br>maybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.<br>And you'll see them around where you live.<br>Clouds are the most egalitarian<br>of nature's displays, because we all have a good,<br>fantastic view of the sky.<br>And these clouds, these rarer clouds,<br>remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.<br>Nothing is more nourishing, more stimulating<br>to an active, inquiring mind than being surprised,<br>being amazed. It's why we're all here at TED, right?<br>But you don't need to rush off<br>away from the familiar, across the world<br>to be surprised.<br>You just need to step outside,<br>pay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday,<br>so mundane that everybody else misses it.<br>One cloud that people rarely miss is this one:<br>the cumulonimbus storm cloud.<br>It's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail.<br>These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous<br>anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.<br>They are an expression of the majestic architecture<br>of our atmosphere.<br>But from down below, they are the embodiment<br>of the powerful, elemental force and power<br>that drives our atmosphere.<br>To be there is to be connected in the driving rain<br>and the hail, to feel connected to our atmosphere.<br>It's to be reminded that we are creatures<br>that inhabit this ocean of air.<br>We don't live beneath the sky. We live within it.<br>And that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere<br>feels to me like an antidote.<br>It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have<br>to feel that we can really ever experience life<br>by watching it on a computer screen, you know,<br>when we're in a wi-fi zone.<br>But the one cloud that best expresses<br>why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever<br>is this one, the cumulus cloud.<br>Right? It forms on a sunny day.<br>If you close your eyes and think of a cloud,<br>it's probably one of these that comes to mind.<br>All those cloud shapes at the beginning,<br>those were cumulus clouds.<br>The sharp, crisp outlines of this formation<br>make it the best one for finding shapes in.<br>And it reminds us<br>of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,<br>what an aimless activity it is.<br>You're not going to change the world<br>by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?<br>It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,<br>which is precisely why it's so important.<br>The digital world conspires to make us feel<br>eternally busy, perpetually busy.<br>You know, when you're not dealing with<br>the traditional pressures of earning a living<br>and putting food on the table, raising a family,<br>writing thank you letters,<br>you have to now contend with<br>answering a mountain of unanswered emails,<br>updating a Facebook page,<br>feeding your Twitter feed.<br>And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing.<br>(Laughter)<br>And sometimes we need -<br>(Applause)<br>Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.<br>We need to be reminded by these<br>patron goddesses of idle fellows<br>that slowing down<br>and being in the present, not thinking about<br>what you've got to do and what you should have done,<br>but just being here, letting your imagination<br>lift from the everyday concerns down here<br>and just being in the present, it's good for you,<br>and it's good for the way you feel.<br>It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity.<br>It's good for your soul.<br>So keep looking up,<br>marvel at the ephemeral beauty,<br>and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.<br>Thank you very much.<br>(Applause)</div><footer></footer></article></main><footer id=footer><div><nav><a href=https://twitter.com/gaubeebangeel rel="me nofollow" target=_blank>Twitter</a> · <a href="https://github.com/gaubee/gaubee.com/tree/main/./src/articles/「TED」Gavin Pretor－Pinney： Cloudy with a chance of joy.md" rel=nofollow target=_blank>Edit this page on GitHub</a></nav><dark-mode-toggle dark="Light Theme" light="Dark Theme" permanent></dark-mode-toggle></div><p><small>除非有特别的说明, 该站点所有直接内容都使用许可证：<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.zh>署名 4.0 国际 (CC BY 4.0)</a></small><blockquote><small>本网站不收集任何访问者的行为与信息，不做任何商业运作，仅仅为个人使用</small></blockquote></footer><script src=/_js/dark-mode-toggle.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/time-elements.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/main.mjs type=module></script>
